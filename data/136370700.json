In this study, a non-thermal method for preparation of an organogel was employed and used for the detection of hen-egg-white-lysozyme (HEWL) via adsorptive stripping voltammetry at an array of aqueous-organogel microinterfaces. Tetrahydrofuran solvent casting was employed to prepare the organogel mixture, hence removing the need for heating of the solution to be gelled, as used in previous studies. Cyclic voltammetry of HEWL at the microinterface array revealed a broad adsorption process on the forward scan, at positive applied potentials, followed by a desorption peak at ca. 0.68 V, indicating the detection of HEWL in this region. Application of an adsorption step, where a constant optimized potential of 0.95 V was applied, followed by voltammetric detection provided for a linear response range of 0.02 \u2013 0.84 \u03bcM and a detection limit of 0.030 \u03bcM for 300 s adsorption. The detection limit was further improved by utilizing differential pulse stripping voltammetry, resulting in detection limits of 0.017 \u03bcM, 0.014 \u03bcM, and 0.010 \u03bcM for adsorptive pre-concentration times of 60, 120 and 300 s, respectively, in unstirred solutions.

In this study, the electrochemical behaviour of fucoidans extracted from two algal species (Undaria pinnatifida and Fucus vesiculosus) was assessed using voltammetry at an array of micro-interfaces formed between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (\u03bcITIES) in which the organic electrolyte phase was gelled. Cyclic voltammetry revealed an adsorption process when scanning to negative potentials, followed by a desorption peak at ca. \u22120.50 V on the reverse scan, indicating the electroactivity of both fucoidans. U. pinnatifida fucoidan showed a more intense voltammetric signal compared to F. vesiculosus fucoidan. In addition, use of tridodecylmethylammonium (TDMA+) or tetradodecylammonium (TDDA+) as the organic phase electrolyte cation provided improved detection of both fucoidans relative to the use of bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium (BTPPA+) cation. Application of adsorptive stripping voltammetry provided a linear response of current with fucoidan concentration in the range 2\u201320 \u03bcg mL\u22121 for U. pinnatifida fucoidan (with TDMA+) and 10\u2013100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 for F. vesiculosus fucoidan (with TDDA+). The combination of TDMA+ in the organic phase and adsorptive pre-concentration for 180 s afforded a detection limit of 1.8 \u03bcg mL\u22121 fucoidan (U. pinnatifida) in aqueous phase of 10 mM NaOH and 2.3 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in synthetic urine (pH adjusted).

TBA did not display any response when only background electrolytes were present in both phases. On the basis of literature reports that surfactants can influence nucleic acid detection, the response in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA+) was examined. With both TBA and CTA+ in the aqueous phase, the transfer current for CTA+ was diminished, signifying the interaction of CTA+ with TBA. Experiments with CTA+ spiked into the organic phase revealed a sharp current peak, consistent with the interfacial formation of a CTA+\u2013TBA complex. However, use of CTA+ as the organic phase electrolyte cation, as the salt with tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate, greatly improved the response to TBA. In this case, a distinctive peak response (at ca. \u22120.25 V) was attributed to the transfer of CTA+ across the soft interface to complex with aqueous phase TBA. Employing this process as a detection step enabled a detection limit of 0.11 \u03bcM TBA (by cyclic voltammetry). Furthermore, the presence of magnesium cations at physiological concentration resulted in the disappearance of the TBA response because of Mg2+-induced folding of TBA. Also, the current response of TBA was decreased by the addition of thrombin, indicating TBA interacted with this binding partner. Finally, the interfacial surfactant\u2013aptamer interaction was explored in a synthetic urine matrix that afforded a detection limit of 0.29 \u03bcM TBA. These results suggest that aptamer-binding interactions can be monitored by electrochemistry at aqueous\u2013organic interfaces and open up a new possibility for detection in aptamer-binding assays.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.8b01172","name":"Electroactivity of Aptamer at Soft Microinterface Arrays","publisher":"Analytical Chemistry (ACS)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAgg2gwBWK4YFGwONf_QjxJ0ts0vEp-YsZ8,NAME_SEARCH,zzum)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKnk_wBaGS9wEtGLJZ7N5ZtegXEaEmPUV0,NAME_SEARCH,LCmt)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"year":2018},"description":"Electrochemical behavior and detection of sulfated carbohydrates was investigated at an array of micro-interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions where the organic phase was gelled.

The aqueous-organic interface has already provided a simple means of electrochemical protein detection, often involving adsorption and ion complexation; however, little is yet known about the protein structure at these electrified interfaces. This work focuses on the interaction between proteins and an electrified aqueous-organic interface via controlled protein electroadsorption. Four proteins known to be electroactive at such interfaces were studied: lysozyme, myoglobin, cytochrome c, and hemoglobin. Following controlled protein electroadsorption onto the interface, ex situ structural characterization of the proteins by FTIR spectroscopy was undertaken, focusing on secondary structural traits within the amide I band. The structural variations observed included unfolding to form aggregated anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets, where the rearrangement was specifically dependent on the interaction with the organic phase. This was supported by MALDI ToF MS measurement, which showed the formation of protein-anion complexes for three of these proteins, and molecular dynamic simulations, which modelled the structure of lysozyme at an aqueous-organic interface. Based on these findings, the modulation of protein secondary structure by interfacial electrochemistry opens up unique prospects to selectively modify proteins.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.8b04227","name":"Secondary Structural Changes in Proteins as a Result of Electroadsorption at Aqueous-Organogel Interfaces","publisher":"Langmuir (ACS)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAgg2gwBWK4YFGwONf_QjxJ0ts0vEp-YsZ8,NAME_SEARCH,zzum)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABSsAUcB3B8f4mVTpYhYOx0XZES_Z57obm0,NAME_SEARCH,nRYs)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApRokkBQYlt0Wld4iq0RhHd-X9Z1uOyD64,NAME_SEARCH,whUR)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKnk_wBaGS9wEtGLJZ7N5ZtegXEaEmPUV0,NAME_SEARCH,LCmt)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"year":2019},"description":"This review critically discusses the developments on open-tubular liquid chromatography (OT-LC) and open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) during 2014\u20132018.

The high virulence, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, and the easy transmissibility of P. aeruginosa necessitate its fast detection and control. The gold standard for detecting P. aeruginosa, the plate culture method, though reliable, takes several days to complete. Therefore, developing accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools for P. aeruginosa is highly desirable. Nanomaterial-based biosensors are at the forefront of detecting P. aeruginosa and its secondary metabolites. This review summarises the biorecognition elements, biomarkers, immobilisation strategies, and current state-of-the-art biosensors for P. aeruginosa. The review highlights the underlying principles of bioreceptor layer engineering and the design of nanomaterial-based optical, electrochemical, mass-based, and thermal biosensors. The advantages and disadvantages of these biosensors and their future point-of-care applications are also discussed.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/aces.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.202400090","title":"Advances in Bioreceptor Layer Engineering in Nanomaterial\u2010based Sensing\u00a0of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and its Metabolites","sourceDomain":"aces.onlinelibrary.wiley.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"PRAISE","count":2},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1},{"type":"LIKE","count":23},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":4}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7200104627160166402","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7200104627160166402","reactionsCount":30,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7200104626669457408","message":{"attributes":[{"start":229,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:biosensors"}}}],"text":"Happy to share my latest collaboration output.

However, many chemicals used during food disinfection, such as chlorine, can react with internal biomolecules and biopolymers in the foods (for example, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and pigments). These transformation products are covalently bonded inside of foods and are only liberated in consumers during digestion. Research on F-DBPs is very young \u2013 but, based on my findings, the transformation products are toxic. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... I hope to continue my research as a tenure-track assistant professor at an R1 institution. I\u2019m mostly excited to develop young researchers and see them thrive in any career direction they want to pursue. I also have a strong interest in Science Communication: I have a YouTube channel (titled: \u201cAdam MA Simpson\u201d) where I aim to humanize academia with a focus on STEM higher education. As a Jamaican-American Dual Citizen of mostly African descent, I also often feature underrepresented minorities in Academia, where they talk about their road to academia, how their research impacts society, and common misconceptions they\u2019d like to dispel. The aim is to show the public that there is a space in STEM for everyone. In the long run, I\u2019d like to produce a talk show where I can help scientists answer questions from everyday people and pop-culture icons. Postdoctoral researcher, AXIS Research Group, NANOlab Center of Excellence, Department of Physics, University of Antwerp, Belgium The elevator pitch\u2026 My father is a sculptor, so I grew up surrounded by all kinds of materials (wood, metal, paints, varnishes, and so on). From a very young age, I learned to appreciate the immense work that goes into both the creation and preservation of a piece of art. While seeing my dad deal with problems associated with the yellowing of coatings, the loss of consistency or cracking, an obsession started to grow in my head: how can I contribute to maintaining the beauty of art? I did not inherit any artistic skills, but I have focused my scientific career on understanding the chemical interactions associated with the degradation of museum artifacts. Today, I study the degradation of historical organic pigments that have been used by painters such as Van Gogh, Gauguin, or Rembrandt. These complex pigments are metal-dye clusters that change their conformation over time. With ESI-Orbitrap, we can detect those small changes over the lifetime of a painting. In addition, these clusters can interact with other components in oil paint, leading to the gradual loss in vibrancy of the original color. These chemical changes can be monitored by using a combination of spectroscopic and high resolution-MS techniques. The ground-breaking aspect of the project is the unique approach of using micro-destructive techniques to drastically improve our understanding of the molecular fragmentation pathways of organic pigments and to expose their triggers. Postdoctoral Fellow, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland The elevator pitch\u2026 Society\u2019s increasing need to transition into a sustainable future requires an energy sector dominated by renewables \u2013 especially for energy conversion and storage. At the heart of these developments are breakthroughs in materials design and synthesis. Conducting polymers are a known material for such applications, but the use of additives, such as surfactants, in manufacturing changes their properties, leading to decreased performance. My research aims to explore the use of the electrochemistry at soft polarized interfaces as a disruptive platform technology to enable controlled interfacial electrosynthesis without the need for additives. Exploring the use of \u201cgreener\u201d alternatives, like Fenton\u2019s reagent, as polymer oxidant will also combine the advantages of \u201cgreen\u201d chemistry and interfacial electropolymerization. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... As a first-generation scientist and coming from a minority background, I know first-hand the struggles of having limited resources and not having someone to look up to in my chosen field. However, all of these did not stop me from trying to achieve my dreams and, hopefully, I can be that \u201csomeone\u201d for any aspiring scientists from the \u201cbarrios.\u201d PhD Candidate at RMIT University, Victoria, Australia The elevator pitch\u2026 There are over 4700 man-made compounds in the environment right now, including poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). We know the dose makes the poison, but we don\u2019t know what impact PFAS are having on ecosystems at the concentrations they are being detected \u2013 little is known about the effects of PFAS, especially the long-term biochemical effects on organisms. I want to determine the effect of PFAS on aquatic organisms, using metabolomics. I want to contribute to the development of molecular markers for PFAS exposure to aid in the development of environmental PFAS regulations that are effective in fully protecting the environment. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... I aim to continue in environmental toxicology research and to contribute to understanding the overall effects of contamination in our wetlands and our terrestrial systems using analytical science. I want to contribute to policy and guideline regulations to protect the environment from anthropogenic causes. Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Centre of Excellence, Biopharmaceutical Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India The elevator pitch\u2026 My research domain is the \u201canalytical characterization of biopharmaceuticals,\u201d with a focus on characterization of critical quality attributes. The in-built quality of these products is a result of precisely controlled processes that result in structurally homogeneous products. Analytical characterization is essential for process control, as well as for evaluating the eventual outcome of the bioprocess (i.e. the drug product). The unambiguous evidence gathered for structural integrity or similarity from these exercises forms the bedrock for regulatory approval of these products. Therefore, a well-designed analytical characterization platform is critical to manufacturing safe and efficacious biodrugs. My research involves using multiple chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques towards development of precise, accurate, robust, and affordable analysis for biotherapeutics. Postgraduate Research Student, Low Carbon Energy and Technologies (LCERT), The University of Nottingham, UK The \u201cwhy\u201d... I enjoy the multidisciplinary nature of analytical science. There are so many research teams that will, at some point, need an analytical scientist to help answer their really important questions. My days are incredibly varied as I get to collaborate on projects across a vast array of fields \u2013 one day I am looking at petroleum fractions and the next single cells or skin tissue. This means I am always learning about new areas and being exposed to cutting edge science. The elevator pitch\u2026 We are investigating ways to prevent the formation of insoluble fuel deposits in internal combustion engines. Deposits are prolific and lead to significantly higher levels of vehicle emissions, especially particulates. They are also tricky to analyze, so we are using state-of-the art MS techniques (mainly using 3D OrbiSIMS) to tell us what\u2019s in our samples and where the key chemical species are located. We collaborate with Innospec, a specialty chemical company with manufacturing and research centers across the world. They use our crucial data to develop new chemical additives to clean engines by removing deposits \u2013 and that means our work has a real-world impact and will help to reduce vehicle emissions and improve global air quality levels. PhD Student, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, UK The \u201cwhy\u201d... Why not! Today, the lack of precision in diagnosis and the prognosis of many diseases is rather alarming. I believe analytical science can play a crucial role in providing answers to these challenges. The elevator pitch\u2026 My research uses MS to identify and quantify novel biomarkers for heart failure (HF). In the UK, 450 people die every day from a heart or circulatory disease and we have a very limited number of biomarkers that can predict HF risk with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. I aim to contribute novel biomarkers for HF to this list and in doing so improve HF prognosis both here in the UK and worldwide. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... I don\u2019t have a \u201cgrand plan.\u201d I hope that one day, I can look back on my thesis and find that some of the potential biomarkers I have looked at are helping reduce the number of deaths from HF across the world. Postgraduate Doctoral Researcher, Centre for Analytical Science, Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University, UK The \u201cwhy\u201d... The thing that draws me most to analytical chemistry is being given the chance to push limits of detection further, to develop new ways of performing measurements, and to prototype new sampling methods to analyze increasingly varied samples. The elevator pitch\u2026 My work involves analyzing the headspace to non-destructively determine volatiles on equipment that is inexpensive and readily portable. I\u2019m also coupling this with machine learning in the form of artificial neural networks in the pursuit of saving researchers time on data analysis. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... My goal for the moment is to continue with and finish my PhD. I\u2019d like to carry on and do a postdoc to apply machine learning to more analytical techniques \u2013 hopefully including analysis of volatiles. I\u2019d very much like to stay in academia as a lecturer, but whether I do a detour through industry first, I\u2019m not sure. PhD Candidate, Duke University Pratt School of Engineering, USA The \u201cwhy\u201d... Analytical science, and in particular environmental analytical chemistry, is a powerful tool for providing information on the chemicals we interact with but cannot see at extremely low levels. This work is so important because even at low concentrations, some chemicals can be harmful to either human health or the quality of the environment. Also, some chemicals aren't even known to exist until we work to identify and quantify them with these instruments. The elevator pitch... I investigate \u2013 specifically within aquatic environments \u2013 the fate, occurrence, and transformation of chemicals associated with plastic that are of possible concern to human health and the environment. In particular, one aspect of my work focuses on identifying the release of endocrine-disrupting chemicals like Bisphenol A (BPA) into simulated seabird stomach digests. The \u201cgrand plan\u201d... My plan is to continue to serve my community by using the information that environmental analytical chemistry provides on water quality to help folks make informed personal and policy-based decisions. What that role looks like over my career will likely evolve with time \u2013 and that is the truly exciting part of it all! Over the course of my Biomedical Sciences degree it dawned on me that my goal of becoming a scientist didn\u2019t quite mesh with my lack of affinity for lab work. Thinking on my decision to pursue biology rather than English at age 15 \u2013 despite an aptitude for the latter \u2013 I realized that science writing was a way to combine what I loved with what I was good at. From there I set out to gather as much freelancing experience as I could, spending 2 years developing scientific content for International Innovation, before completing an MSc in Science Communication. After gaining invaluable experience in supporting the communications efforts of CERN and IN-PART, I joined Texere \u2013 where I am focused on producing consistently engaging, cutting-edge and innovative content for our specialist audiences around the world. By the time I finished my degree in Microbiology I had come to one conclusion \u2013 I did not want to work in a lab. Instead, I decided to move to the south of Spain to teach English. After two brilliant years, I realized that I missed science, and what I really enjoyed was communicating scientific ideas \u2013 whether that be to four-year-olds or mature professionals. On returning to England I landed a role in science writing and found it combined my passions perfectly. Now at Texere, I get to hone these skills every day by writing about the latest research in an exciting, creative way.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/theanalyticalscientist.com\/business-education\/the-power-list-slam-spotlight-on-the-future","title":"The Power List Slam: Spotlight on the Future","sourceDomain":"theanalyticalscientist.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":16},{"type":"PRAISE","count":3},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7171337266613641216","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7171337266613641216","reactionsCount":22,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7171337266009718784","message":{"attributes":[{"start":116,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:grateful"}}},{"start":126,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:earlycareerresearchers"}}}],"text":"Thank you, The Analytical Scientist, for this feature.
