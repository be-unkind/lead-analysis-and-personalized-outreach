Our aim was to investigate parental knowledge regarding recommendations for managing LUTS, as well as to identify barriers within school environments that may negatively impact children with LUTS.\n\nOur study highlights the lack of clear classroom rules surrounding bathroom use, with parental awareness often low and varied classroom policies noted. Teacher's limited training in bladder health is evident, with only a minority receiving relevant information. To address these gaps, interventions should focus on teacher professional development and the implementation of consistent, bladder-friendly school policies. Initiatives must also consider student concerns such as cleanliness, safety, and inclusivity to promote healthy bladder behaviors and improve overall well-being.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Kan for her mentorship and support, and to Pranaya for her invaluable contributions to this project.\n\nAccess the full publication here: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gntUSbiZ\n\n #PediatricUrology #Research #Publication #StanfordMedicine"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194040139948433410"}}},{"createdAt":1715273520000,"insightId":"480a68e7-eb9f-4ce9-a678-849059c80349","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7189654499244806144,7194378822694125570)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7189654499244806144","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thanks for sharing!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7189654499244806144"}}},{"createdAt":1710185100000,"insightId":"94dd1c68-fa89-41d1-afbf-a735fd67d8cb","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7173033815911718913,7173036399942709248)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7173033815911718913","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations my friend!
