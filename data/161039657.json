Reproducible data and new insights obtained were used to develop a comprehensive mitigation strategy that my team and I successfuly implemented in an ongoing Ph1 Clinicial Trial with a novel MMAF-payloaded ADC, resulting in a dramatically improved safety profile.  The protocols and research summary I developed were utilized to rescue the development of other ADCs facing ocular toxicity challenges, including Tisotumab Vedotin (Tivdak) and Belentamab Mafodotin (BLENREP).  In the case of Tivdak, after handing off to the Product Team they were able to adopt, adapt, and integrate the mitigation strategy into the pivotal trial used for FDA approval, as well as the product label, commercial launch, and post-launch commercialization of the drug.  For this project, other activities included serving as cross-functional leader, internal SME, and advisor to the Leadership Team regarding a partnered molecule utilizing Seattle Genetics technologies.  I enjoyed the chance to work with pre-clinical and research colleagues, liaison with national-level corneal specialists and conduct the first Virtual Advisory Board at Seattle Genetics.  This approach accelerated evaluation and implementation of the mitigation strategy into ongoing clinical trials with substantial ROI.  With the support of Leadership, cross-functional team members and internal stakeholders, and tremendous efforts by the Tivdak Product team, our company was able to bring forward a new therapeutic option to address unmet medical needs in women facing recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.","title":"Ocular Toxicity Mitigation Project - Successfully improved safety profile for Antibody-Drug Conjugates","startedOn":{"month":1,"year":2017}},{"endedOn":{"month":1,"year":2014},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmZRSkBSVnNoqlrMJmqNtw9pnAvhF4u2Iw,NAME_SEARCH,Ed_g)"}],"description":"During a large scale EMR replacement project, the Cerner implementation team worked with Physicians, Advanced-Practice Providers, and Nurses in rolling out Cerner ORCA and Computerized Provider Order-Entry (CPOE).
