Glycoproteins carry structurally diverse oligosaccharides, called glycans, that are involved at the interface of protein-biomolecular interactions and thus determine protein stability, selectivity, and activity.  The significance of protein glycosylation to biological systems has been exemplified by several diseases associated with various cancers and the immune system. Unsurprisingly, it follows that insights into the structure and function of glycans have yielded a profound impact on the development of therapeutic glycoproteins. Manipulating glycan structures present an effective strategy to improve their efficacy and safety by modulating immunological responses, circulatory half-life, and effector functions. Thus, glycoengineering represents a versatile tool and a great opportunity to create better medicines through glycan remodeling. In recent decades, our understanding of the in vitro activity of glycosylation enzymes is growing rapidly. Some of the enzymes can even function on intact glycoproteins, which opens a new window for glycan remodeling. The present invention provides a solid-phase glycan remodeling (SPGR) system wherein glycosylation enzymatic reactions are carried out on glycoprotein substrates immobilized on resins. The SPGR system of the present invention enables efficient reaction swapping, substrate purification, and the recovery of both products and engineering enzymes. The present invention is particularly useful for glycoengineering immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies or IgG) to provide antibodies that have predominantly particular glycoform profiles.

The spike protein has been the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Analytical reports have described the glycan heterogeneity of the spike protein. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, experimental data on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology remains scarce. Building an understanding of their roles in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor-binding affinity revealed opposite regulatory effects of the RBD glycans with and without sialylation, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor-binding affinity. In combination with molecular dynamics simulation, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2.

Application of this method is demonstrated by conjugation of anti-HER2 human and mouse IgGs with a cytotoxic drug, monomethyl auristatin E. The glycan bridge showed outstanding stability, and the resulting ADCs eliminated HER2-expressing cancer cells effectively. Moreover, our strategy preserves the feasibility of glycan structure remodeling to fine-tune the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic properties of ADCs through glycoengineering.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.3c00302","name":"Site-Specific Antibody Conjugation Using Modified Bisected N-Glycans: Method Development and Potential toward Tunable Effector Function","publisher":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABC4z5oBqWTuKYNd9HCsmWGb6sdpu-gteS8,NAME_SEARCH,SONP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA8ebqQBrqA52FvezplbF4JYnx78XwnclU8,NAME_SEARCH,flxo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAClfO7QBn4xlSBZBlAnoWEdkGNG16wGKl8A,NAME_SEARCH,GtZ5)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAONNF8BmvO6AWrKHI0h7L3fXmxFC9-Cr7I,NAME_SEARCH,taK2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADnZ1F8Bk4FPTQ3zThbzRd7xUmcKkW-2Rnc,NAME_SEARCH,PPe5)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADAdyX0B66SBOolv6az9FTXBYxS_lY9nvvg,NAME_SEARCH,Brpz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAul4-EBdqg39wtEkHH7fhJD4kVZ0TJhzZg,NAME_SEARCH,X9Lk)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADXD4oB_QhpfmTzMZghVTPkwDOY-JMlP1U,NAME_SEARCH,YjEr)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1711669680000,"insightId":"9dd01c4f-3ddf-4e75-a210-df7a123d9677","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7177962373079535616,7179263097147138048)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7177962373079535616","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congrats Heath!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7177962373079535616"}}}]}
