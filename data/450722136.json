Cancer cells can develop the ability to lose sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs during reciprocal\ncrosstalk between cells and their interaction with the tumour microenvironment (TME). Cell-to-cell\ncommunication regulates a cascade of interdependent events essential for disease development and\nprogression and can be mediated by several signalling pathways. Exosome-mediated communication is\none of the pathways regulating these events. Tumour-derived exosomes (TDE) are believed to have the\nability to modulate TMEs and participate in multidrug resistance mechanisms. In this work, we studied the\neffect of the natural defensin from common bean, PvD1, on the formation of exosomes by breast cancer\nMCF-7 cells, mainly the modulatory effect it has on the level of CD63 and CD9 tetraspanins. Moreover,\nwe followed the interaction of PvD1 with biological and model membranes of selected composition, by\nbiophysical and imaging techniques. Overall, the results show that PvD1 induces a dual effect on MCF-7\nderived exosomes: the peptide attenuates the recruitment of CD63 and CD9 to exosomes intracellularly\nand binds to the mature exosomes in the extracellular environment. This work uncovers the exosome-mediated\nanticancer action of PvD1, a potential nutraceutical agent.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2019\/NR\/C9NR07843F#!divAbstract","name":"Plant defensin PvD1 modulates the membrane composition of breast tumour-derived exosomes","publisher":"Nanoscale","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABrdeVgBhHnvhiAB_3ESWO9VS99AO_A8lmg,NAME_SEARCH,SH7I)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":6,"year":2020},"description":"Available treatments of invasive fungal infection have limitations including toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative solutions. Due to the unique mode of action and high selectivity, plant defensins (PDs) are worthy therapeutic candidates. Chemical synthesis remains a preferred method for the production of many peptide-based therapeutics. Given the relatively long sequence of PDs, as well as their complicated posttranslational modifications, the synthetic route can be considered challenging. Here we describe a total synthesis of PvD1, the defensin from the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris. Analytical, structural and functional characterization revealed that both natural and synthetic peptides fold into a canonical CS\u03b1\u03b2 motif stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds. Moreover, synthetic PvD1 retained the biological activity against four different Candida species and showed no toxicity in-vivo. Adding the high resistance of synthetic PvD1 to proteolytic degradation we claim that conditions are now met to consider plant defensins druggable biologicals.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.0c00543","name":"Synthesis, structure, and activity of the antifungal plant defensin PvD1","publisher":"Journal of Medical Chemistry ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABrdeVgBhHnvhiAB_3ESWO9VS99AO_A8lmg,NAME_SEARCH,SH7I)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1717203840000,"insightId":"34c97e56-9a68-4b3b-961c-354d6e044b36","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7202392786325684225,7202474989067911170)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7202392786325684225","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Karen for making it possible!
