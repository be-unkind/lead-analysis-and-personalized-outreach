This NAD(P)-dependent catalytic process relies on the intact structural and functional activity of the cofactor binding, substrate interaction, and the oligomerization of ALDHs. Disruptions on the activity of ALDHs, however, could result in the accumulation of cytotoxic aldehydes, which have been linked with a wide range of diseases, including both cancers as well as neurological and developmental disorders. In our previous works, we have successfully characterised the structure\u2013function relationships of the missense variants of other proteins. We therefore applied a similar analysis pipeline to identify potential molecular drivers of pathogenic ALDH missense mutations. Variants data were first carefully curated and labelled as cancer-risk, non-cancer diseases, and benign. We then leveraged various computational biophysical methods to describe the changes caused by missense mutations, informing a bias of detrimental mutations with destabilising effects. Cooperating with these insights, several machine learning approaches were further utilised to investigate the combination of features, revealing the necessity of the conservation of ALDHs. Our work aims to provide important biological perspectives on pathogenic consequences of missense mutations of ALDHs, which could be invaluable resources in the development of cancer treatment.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/24\/12\/10157","name":"Identifying the Molecular Drivers of Pathogenic Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Missense Mutations in Cancer and Non-Cancer Diseases","publisher":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwOdngBC2Ge6-jx9qgHDVRwOYH8iLW_sDU,NAME_SEARCH,HJ6p)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":8,"year":2019},"description":"I interned in this work.\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders affect around one billion people worldwide. They can arise from a combination of genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Aging is the leading risk factor for most chronic illnesses of old age, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. A progressive neurodegenerative process and neuroinflammation occur, and no current therapies can prevent, slow, or halt disease progression. To date, no novel disease-modifying therapies have been shown to provide significant benefit for patients who suffer from these devastating disorders. Therefore, early diagnosis and the discovery of new targets and novel therapies are of upmost importance. Neurodegenerative diseases, like in other age-related disorders, the progression of pathology begins many years before the onset of symptoms. Many efforts in this field have led to the conclusion that exits some similar events among these diseases that can explain why the aging brain is so vulnerable to suffer neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the current knowledge about these diseases by summarizing the most common features of major neurodegenerative disorders, their causes and consequences, and the proposed novel therapeutic approaches.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/20\/3\/719","name":"Novel Approaches for the Treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Disease","publisher":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwOdngBC2Ge6-jx9qgHDVRwOYH8iLW_sDU,NAME_SEARCH,HJ6p)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714168380000,"insightId":"009be69f-a5cd-4d95-8fd1-6030fb8cb48c","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5622AQEpevcaurtiiQ\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1714168397299?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=xfWQIDoN_MX0KKLyASiL732ed0HhI6adftI_UiGF8pw"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"PRAISE","count":5},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1},{"type":"LIKE","count":40},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7189743369483386880","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7189743369483386880","reactionsCount":54,"commentsCount":6,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7189743368363556865","message":{"attributes":[{"start":530,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gZiJEwwp"}}}],"text":"I\u2019m hiring!\n\nLooking for someone who:\n\u2714\ufe0f Has a scientific background, including scientific research, literature evaluation and dissemination, and science writing\n\u2714\ufe0f Excels in communicating science to the public in a way that inspires and intrigues\n\u2714\ufe0f Thrives in fast-paced environments, loves to learn, and is excited to launch into new horizons of growth on a mission to serve human + planetary health\n\nThis role will be fully remote, and include independent work as well as team and cross-functional collaboration.\n\nApply here: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gZiJEwwp"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7189743368363556865"}}},{"createdAt":1712874780000,"insightId":"eb7ef48a-68aa-4bd2-924f-e5c90fe256ab","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":4},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7184317717980540928","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7184317717980540928","reactionsCount":6,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7184317717468917760","message":{"attributes":[{"start":80,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:11406972"}}}],"text":"As a former bioinformatician\u2026 this might be the current innovation happening at Seed Health that I\u2019m most excited about.
