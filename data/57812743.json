Classically, the clinical findings consist of periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by fever and leukocytosis. However, the classic signs are not always present, and symptoms can be nonspecific and overlap with other causes of abdominal pain. While the clinical diagnosis may be straightforward in patients who present with classic signs and symptoms, atypical presentations may result in diagnostic confusion and delay in treatment. Among imaging methods, Ultrasound (US) is a valuable tool, which is widely available, can be performed at the bedside, does not use ionizing radiation, is relatively inexpensive, and may show evidence of other causes of abdominal pain. Methods: We evaluated the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of AA, at a tertiary care hospital of tribal, hilly, Wayanad in Kerala, involving 224 patients from Jan 2015 to July 2016. Ultrasound findings were finally compared with surgical \/ pathological\nreport of appendices removed at surgery. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosis of AA, in our study were found to be 99.2 %, 76.7 %, 87.2% , 98.5% and 90.6 % respectively. Conclusion: Although the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of sonography vary greatly in studies evaluating the imaging diagnosis of acute appendicitis, it should be the first imaging modality when there is clinical concern for acute appendicitis.\nKeywords: Abdominal Pain, Acute Abdomen, Acute Appendicitis, Appendectomy, Sonography, Ultrasound.

Early clinical detection of\nbreast carcinoma through screening has led to the detection of the tumor at a relatively earlier clinical stage, which\ndefinitely reduced the mortality.

The present study aims to observe the diagnostic accuracy of US, in the assessment of breast\nmasses compared to pathologic findings. Methods: This analytical, retrospective study was conducted on 246 patients that\nwere referred for US scan in a tertiary care hospital of southern Tamilnadu, between January to December 2017. 110\nbreast masses from 246 patients were evaluated with US & US guided FNAB.
