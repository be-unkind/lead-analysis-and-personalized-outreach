The first is the fabrication of the piezoresistive pressure sensor die; the second is the signal conditioning and electronic integration, and the third is packaging. The methods used in this work are not new; the goal was to investigate the feasibility of making a device that could be produced at affordable cost for the Indian market. No cost analysis is carried out in this paper but most of the work is done with what is available in India. The main challenge faced in this work was in affixing the wires onto the sensor die. The packaged sensor capsule has a diameter of 2  mm and length of 10 mm. One prototype sensor, which was tested, has a sensitivity of 8 mV\/V\/mm of Hg of pressure, which meets the requirement of resolving 1 mm of Hg. The sensor is also capable of measuring the temperature and compensating for variations due to it.","publisher":"5th ISSS National Conference on MEMS, Smart Materials, Structures andSystems","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOnKx4BIZdT0krCaZSk7wMjMyTeJZkK5Xs,NAME_SEARCH,HkFx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA5iMzsBgEyeXC4gMnrXjXKcm6MkPiG0tzY,NAME_SEARCH,b015)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":19,"year":2013},"description":"In India, obesity is increasing at an alarming rate especially in urban areas. Obesity primarily increases the risks for coronary heart diseases,calculi in liver and gall bladder and reproductive health diseases. These diseases are diagnostically confirmed with the help of ultrasound imaging. This mode of imaging has been predominantly used in quantifying and qualifying the diseases associated with human soft tissues. However, the effectiveness of imaging by ultrasound depends largely on the body fat content. Large deposits of fat below the subcutaneous layer in obese people attenuate the ultrasound waves. This results in reduced penetration of ultrasound into the body, thereby affects the quality of the image. Thus the image taken up by the ultrasound device in obese patient is not of good resolution and doesn't provide enough details to give a substantial diagnosis. This is a potential hazard which may even lead to wrong diagnosis or failure of early detection. So, the obese patients are advised to go for expensive and riskier imaging modalities even when it is not really required. Moreover, obese patients need specially sized MRI, CT gantry which will suit them. But, it is not practically possible for all hospitals to buy those expensive imaging devices and they are not available in India as of now. This paper proposes potential improvements in the imaging technique which would help to solve the challenges faced in carrying out ultrasound imaging on obese patients.","url":"http:\/\/www.ndt.net\/article\/apcndt2013\/papers\/178.pdf","name":"Significance and Advancement of Ultrasonography in obese people","publisher":"14th Asia Pacific Conference on Non-Destructive testing 2013, Mumbai","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOnKx4BIZdT0krCaZSk7wMjMyTeJZkK5Xs,NAME_SEARCH,HkFx)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715266620000,"insightId":"110285b9-1b28-4d9c-9baa-1376af256bd5","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"title":{"text":""},"mediaType":"VIDEO","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/dms.licdn.com\/playlist\/vid\/D5610AQHeaL5CkDN66g\/videocover-firstframe-low\/0\/1715266649852?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=nl4ijA_SDWA7tYW4u0TnvhtVZ9xyLAS1qjgmRkXP9p0"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194349844998623232","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194349844998623232","reactionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194349844998623232","message":{"attributes":[{"length":15,"start":191,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:futurefriendly"}}},{"length":10,"start":216,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:teamtelus"}}}],"text":"The TELUS Pollinator Fund backs tech innovators doing good \ud83d\udc9a Flash Forest does crucial work, planting 1 million trees a day using their cutting edge technology \ud83c\udf32 Together, we\u2019re making the #FutureFriendly for all. #TeamTELUS"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194349844998623232"}}},{"createdAt":1713532140000,"insightId":"7d4bd906-0fd8-4e4e-a762-505a459cfda7","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7187053185847517184,7187074907455807489)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7187053185847517184","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congrats ASHUTOSH"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7187053185847517184"}}},{"createdAt":1713068400000,"insightId":"b32619e5-24ba-43f5-8136-7300811c90f1","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7185005594712399872,7185129663428505600)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7185005594712399872","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7185005594712399872"}}},{"createdAt":1711338720000,"insightId":"1e0de880-6046-46ac-aaf9-f22e4ee86cc9","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7177747827672911872,7177875013071503360)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7177747827672911872","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Professor Bhat also helped me build my skills during my internship.
