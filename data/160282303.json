Here, we developed a single-cell nanobiopsy platform based on scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) for continuous sampling of intracellular content from individual cells. The nanobiopsy platform uses electrowetting within a nanopipette to extract cellular material from living cells with minimal disruption of the cellular milieu. We demonstrate the subcellular resolution of the nanobiopsy platform by isolating small subpopulations of mitochondria from single living cells, and quantify mutant mitochondrial genomes in those single cells with high throughput sequencing technology. These findings may provide the foundation for dynamic subcellular genomic analysis.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn405097u","name":"Compartmental Genomics in Single Living Cells","publisher":"American Chemical Society Nano","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmNtr8B5HzEjCsGurBcF7TRIhMou_WV1Pw,NAME_SEARCH,mkMN)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2012},"description":"Manipulation and analysis of single cells is the next frontier in understanding processes that control the function and fate of cells.

Our group has used nanopipettes as a biosensor, and is now continuing to use nanopipettes for single-cell manipulation. We developed a single-cell manipulation platform based on quartz nanopipettes. The system uses scanning microscopy techniques to position the nanopipette with nanoscale precision.
