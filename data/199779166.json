Conventional topical formulations of clotrimazole are intended to treat infections by effective penetration of drugs into the stratum corneum. However, drawbacks such as poor dermal bioavailability, poor penetration, and variable drug levels limit the efficiency. The present study aims to load clotrimazole into ufosomes and evaluate its topical bioavailability. Clotrimazole loaded ufosomes were prepared using cholesterol and sodium oleate by thin film hydration technique and evaluated for size, polydispersity index, and entrapment efficiency to obtain optimized formulation. Optimized formulation was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Skin diffusion studies and tape-stripping were performed using human skin to determine the amount of clotrimazole accumulated in different layers of the skin. Results showed that the optimized formulation had vesicle size <250 nm with ~84% entrapment efficiency. XRD and DSC confirmed the entrapment of clotrimazole into ufosomes. No permeation was observed through the skin up to 24 h following the permeation studies. Tape-stripping revealed that ufosomes led to accumulation of more clotrimazole in the skin compared to marketed formulation (Perrigo). Overall, results revealed the capability of ufosomes in improving the skin bioavailability of clotrimazole.","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/31470517","name":"Clotrimazole Loaded Ufosomes for Topical Delivery: Formulation Development and In-Vitro Studies.","publisher":"MDPI\/Molecules","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvoY14Bgv_IaPaJe7eSSOfRLoaA7u_b84o,NAME_SEARCH,60ey)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":13,"year":2020},"description":"Topical drug delivery is an attractive alternative to conventional methods because of advantages such as non-invasive delivery, by-pass of first pass metabolism, and improved patient compliance. However, several factors such as skin, physicochemical properties of the drug, and vehicle characteristics influence the permeation.

The aim of the study was to develop and investigate topical semisolid preparations (creams and gels) with ibuprofen as the model drug and investigate the effect of various formulation parameters on the in-vitro performance across the Strat-M\u00ae membrane using flow-through cells. In addition, the physical stability of the developed formulations was investigated by studying viscosity, pH, and appearance. All the formulations developed in the study had appealing appearance with smooth texture and no signs of separation. Viscosity and pH of the formulations were acceptable.

Cumulative release of lutein was higher in PLGA nanoparticles (100% (w\/w) within 24 h) compared to PLGA-PEG-FOLATE nanoparticles (\u223c80% (w\/w) in 48 h).\n\nConclusion: Lutein-loaded PLGA-PEG-FOLATE nanoparticles could be a potential treatment for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32842813\/","name":"Preparation and characterization of lutein loaded folate conjugated polymeric nanoparticles","publisher":"Taylor and Francis\/Journal of Microencapsulation","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvoY14Bgv_IaPaJe7eSSOfRLoaA7u_b84o,NAME_SEARCH,60ey)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":24,"year":2020},"description":"Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of visual loss and is responsible for approximately 9% of global blindness. It is a progressive eye disorder seen in elderly people (>65 years) mainly affecting the macula. Lutein, a carotenoid, is an antioxidant, and has shown neuroprotective properties in the retina. However, lutein has poor bioavailability owing to poor aqueous solubility. Drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to the blood-retina barrier. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) expresses the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) transport system which selectively uptakes biotin by active transport. In this study, we aimed to enhance lutein uptake into retinal cells using PLGA-PEG-biotin nanoparticles. Lutein loaded polymeric nanoparticles were prepared using O\/W solvent-evaporation method. Particle size and zeta potential (ZP) were determined using Malvern Zetasizer. Other characterizations included differential scanning calorimetry, FTIR, and in-vitro release studies. In-vitro uptake and cytotoxicity studies were conducted in ARPE-19 cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Lutein was successfully encapsulated into PLGA and PLGA-PEG-biotin nanoparticles (<250 nm) with uniform size distribution and high ZP. The entrapment efficiency of lutein was \u224856% and \u224875% for lutein-loaded PLGA and PLGA-PEG-biotin nanoparticles, respectively. FTIR and DSC confirmed encapsulation of lutein into nanoparticles. Cellular uptake studies in ARPE-19 cells confirmed a higher uptake of lutein with PLGA-PEG-biotin nanoparticles compared to PLGA nanoparticles and lutein alone. In vitro cytotoxicity results confirmed that the nanoparticles were safe, effective, and non-toxic. Findings from this study suggest that lutein-loaded PLGA-PEG-biotin nanoparticles can be potentially used for treatment of AMD for higher lutein uptake.\n","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32847030\/","name":"Lutein-Loaded, Biotin-Decorated Polymeric Nanoparticles Enhance Lutein Uptake in Retinal Cells","publisher":"MDPI\/Pharmaceutics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvoY14Bgv_IaPaJe7eSSOfRLoaA7u_b84o,NAME_SEARCH,60ey)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":19,"year":2020},"description":"Cryoprotectants are often required in lyophilization to reduce or eliminate agglomeration of solute or suspended materials. The aim of this study was to select a cryoprotecting agent and optimize its concentration in a solid lipid nanoparticle formulation. Progesterone-loaded stearic acid solid lipid nanoparticles (SA-P SLNs) were prepared by hot homogenization with high speed mixing and sonication. The stearic acid content was 4.6% w\/w and progesterone was 0.46% w\/w of the initial formulation. Multiple surfactants were evaluated, and a lecithin and sodium taurocholate system was chosen. Three concentrations of surfactant were then evaluated, and a concentration of 2% w\/w was chosen based on particle size, polydispersity, and zeta potential. Agglomeration of SA-P SLNs after lyophilization was observed as measured by increased particle size. Dextran, glycine, mannitol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), sorbitol, and trehalose were evaluated as cryoprotectants by both an initial freeze\u2013thaw analysis and after lyophilization. Once selected as the cryoprotectant, trehalose was evaluated at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% for optimal concentration, with 20% trehalose being finally selected as the level of choice. Evaluation by DSC confirmed intimate interaction between stearic acid and progesterone in the SA-P SLNs, and polarized light microscopy shows successful lyophilization of the trehalose\/SA-P SLN. A short term 28-day stability study suggests the need for refrigeration of the final lyophilized SA-P SLNs in moisture vapor impermeable packaging.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32961738\/","name":"Selection of Cryoprotectant in Lyophilization of Progesterone-Loaded Stearic Acid Solid Lipid Nanoparticles","publisher":"MDPI\/Pharmaceutics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvoY14Bgv_IaPaJe7eSSOfRLoaA7u_b84o,NAME_SEARCH,60ey)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":28,"year":2021},"description":"Breast cancer, specifically metastatic breast, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women. This is mainly due to relapse and reoccurrence of tumor. The primary reason for cancer relapse is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) hampering the treatment and prognosis. MDR can occur due to a multitude of molecular events, including increased expression of efflux transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, or MRP1; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; and resistance development in breast cancer stem cells. Excessive dose dumping in chemotherapy can cause intrinsic anti-cancer MDR to appear prior to chemotherapy and after the treatment. Hence, novel targeted nanomedicines encapsulating chemotherapeutics and gene therapy products may assist to overcome cancer drug resistance. Targeted nanomedicines offer innovative strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy while permitting enhanced selectivity to cancer cells. Targeted nanotheranostics permit targeted drug release, precise breast cancer diagnosis, and importantly, the ability to overcome MDR. The article discusses various nanomedicines designed to selectively target breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and breast cancer stem cells. In addition, the review discusses recent approaches, including combination nanoparticles (NPs), theranostic NPs, and stimuli sensitive or \"smart\" NPs. Recent innovations in microRNA NPs and personalized medicine NPs are also discussed. Future perspective research for complex targeted and multi-stage responsive nanomedicines for metastatic breast cancer is discussed.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33925129\/","name":"Drug Resistance in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Tumor Targeted Nanomedicine to the Rescue","publisher":"IJMS\/MDPI","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvoY14Bgv_IaPaJe7eSSOfRLoaA7u_b84o,NAME_SEARCH,60ey)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB8qPTgBqzkiqvzpQVevVvebM3KPpkxabeg,NAME_SEARCH,Miri)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABgUJ0kB6DwCawWcy0tk3uFBFDLLnAVRqhM,NAME_SEARCH,a6Jv)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1711419240000,"insightId":"9b80f416-b8cd-4e78-b541-beae5837003b","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7178049312063447040,7178212779403702273)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7178049312063447040","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations Irene!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7178049312063447040"}}}]}
