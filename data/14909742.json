This drawback is not solely due to the lack of column efficiency, but is mainly due to insufficient selectivity and the need to separate the analytes of interest with orthogonal retention mechanisms. In this regard, two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) is currently attracting much interest for its markedly higher resolving power compared to one-dimensional separation.\nIn this work, three applications of 2D-LC from the pharmaceutical industry are presented with the goal not only to increase peak capacity, but also to support investigations. In the first application, the retention times of peaks of interest are matched under different mobile phase conditions for the purpose of transferring the method from a mass spectrometry (MS) incompatible\nbuffer to an MS compatible buffer. The second application includes developing a method for simultaneous detection and quantitation of degradants and aggregates in a biologics and small molecule combination product. The third application supports method development by confirming the purity of separated peaks using orthogonal separation conditions in the first and second dimensions and to investigate mass balance issues where some peaks are expected to elute in the solvent front.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10337-018-3474-8","name":"Two\u2011Dimensional Liquid Chromatography (2D\u2011LC) in Pharmaceutical Analysis: Applications Beyond Increasing Peak Capacity","publisher":"Chromatographia","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADjgS4BfIE4ew5MUCQUmWnHuMLz7dCstwo,NAME_SEARCH,qaUX)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUWw8wBowo0Yoy0NhAraQ64G5OUQiHSinQ,NAME_SEARCH,pJpc)"}]},{"name":"Extending the limits of size exclusion chromatography: Simultaneous separation of free payloads and related species from antibody drug conjugates and their aggregates","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":18,"year":2018},"description":"Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is commonly performed in isocratic conditions to separate partiallyexcluded molecules from the pores of the stationary phase, based on their difference in hydrodynamicvolume. In this work, a baseline resolution was obtained between the monomeric antibody drug conjugate(ADC) and high molecular weight species (HMWS). Besides HMWS, small free payloads, linkers and linker-payloads of ADCs, which would not be discriminated solely based on their size (MW < 1.5 kDa), were alsoseparated on the same SEC column by applying sequentially an acetonitrile gradient after the elutionof the largest species. Such an approach allowed a simultaneous i) measurement of the HMWS amountunder native conditions, and ii) quantitation of the free payloads, within one generic SEC run. For thispurpose, a state-of-the-art 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm SEC column packed with 2.0 \u0002m particles and 250 \u00c5 pore size,was selected to achieve fast separations of the species within 10 min.

The SECxRPLC multipleheart cutting mode was operated by using a modern 2D-LC instrument containing twelve 120 \u0002L samplingloops. Repeatabilities (0.01% < RSD < 3.68%) and recoveries (between 82% and 107%) were found to besuitable with both approaches (SEC and SECxRPLC), whereas the LOQs remain similar.

Finally, full validationusing accuracy profile approach was successfully achieved for the determination of impurities B, D, Fand G in salbutamol sulfate raw material.

In preclinical and clinical studies, there is a significant number of site-specific ADCs (also known as third generation ADCs), which are more homogeneous than their previous generations. These new ADC formats, in which the inter-chain disulphide bridges (hinge cysteines) are not reduced, also need to be deeply characterized. In particular, various quality attributes (QAs) have to be determined, such as free antibody level, average drug to antibody ratio (DAR) and drug distribution. In this contribution, a non-commercial site-specific conjugated ADC has been analyzed by RPLC. Our results demonstrated that RPLC has a huge potential to determine QAs and can replace the historically used HIC methods as RPLC provides better separation quality for such type of ADCs. Site-specific ADCs can be analyzed in RPLC at intact level without the need for sample preparation. A further advantage of RPLC is that it enables the direct coupling to MS and thus allows the fine identification of all eluting species.\n","publisher":"Journal of Chromatography A","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.chroma.2018.12.020","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADjgS4BfIE4ew5MUCQUmWnHuMLz7dCstwo,NAME_SEARCH,qaUX)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABDuSKoBTl0qL9t-NB4iouMkJGvam3ctzJA,NAME_SEARCH,3BA-)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715947080000,"insightId":"6c67cbeb-4963-4fa7-8b2d-52f47ee298bc","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7197203738418180097","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197203738418180097","reactionsCount":8,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7197203737973506049","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Happy to see the deadline is extended so busy scientists get the chance to submit their abstracts!"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQGrYjt0Vy8l1w\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715927221916?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=HlSSyAJetl-Aaxlq0GUqqzrjU_nJprWVaMRxMaqBKJA"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7197120415058534400","message":{"attributes":[{"start":106,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ehFKinut"}}},{"start":165,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eCPyFi-7"}}},{"start":207,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e6ecZ8aP"}}},{"start":253,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e-9DcQZi"}}},{"start":306,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ezspCggi"}}},{"start":355,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eiQ7xBQn"}}},{"start":430,"length":15,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"http:\/\/www.pba2024.org"}}}],"text":"Abstracts submission deadline for PBA 2024 has been extended to May 30, 2024!\n\nAbstracts submission form: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ehFKinut\n\nImportant links:\n- Registration: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eCPyFi-7\n- Short Courses: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e6ecZ8aP \n- Invited speakers: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e-9DcQZi\n- Young scientists rewards: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ezspCggi\n- Grants opportunities: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eiQ7xBQn\n\nFor all information about PBA 2024, please visit www.pba2024.org."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7197120415058534400"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7197203737973506049"}}},{"createdAt":1715179740000,"insightId":"b7b5324d-2117-47cd-b59f-2e056f633537","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":12}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193985336568393729","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193985336568393729","reactionsCount":12,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193985335847014401","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"some really great short courses led by an array of fantastic trainers.
