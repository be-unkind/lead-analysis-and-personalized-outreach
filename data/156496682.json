{"summary":"14 years ago, I experienced a major life-changing event. Out of what seemed like a dead end, a new beginning was born. Because my story resonated with people, I was asked to speak at a church event, which led to me being asked to volunteer with the youth program. I had never done anything like that before, but from the very first meeting, I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I love helping people. \n\nLoving on kids led to a successful career in part-time youth ministry. During my season in student ministry, I supported myself with my personal training business, Motivation Fitness LLC. In 2012, I made it to the final round of interviews for a high-profile, full-time paid student ministry job. I didn't get the job for a couple of reasons, but the most important reason was that I lacked a degree. I decided that I would never again miss an opportunity because of my education. I got my GED, went to college and have since graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in history, won the oral presentation category in the 2018 UAFS Undergraduate Symposium, and was awarded the academic excellence award in history. I am currently working on my graduate degree in Social Work at the Universtiy of Arkansas Little Rock.  \n\nI am the proud father of one all-grown-up son. My career aspirations are to create real-world solutions for problems facing the local community. I am an entrepreneur at heart, a successful business owner, and I have leadership experience that can flourish in a variety of contexts.   \n\nI love research, and I love solving complex social problems. I successfully launched a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit company THEWORD INC. which is designated to assist underserved youth and their communities, specifically as it pertains to advocacy, brain health, emotional well-being, education, and personal development.","lastName":"Scott, MSW, ADC, RDS","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:156496682","geoRegion":"Fort Smith, Arkansas, United States","fullName":"Vini Scott, MSW, ADC, RDS","firstName":"Vini","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Harbor House","description":"AADC - Advanced Arkansas Drug Counselor (in training)","title":"Counselor - Substance abuse, trauma, ","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"2-10","headquarters":{"country":"United States","postalCode":"33138"},"website":"http:\/\/www.harborhouse1.org","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/harbor-house\/","industry":"Mental Health Care"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:844138","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":5,"numMonths":10},"startedOn":{"month":8,"year":2018}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlT8yoB--yku6Fbh9ldzHpeQI_dVNyEvX8,NAME_SEARCH,1098)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1717096529394?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=zWFzs2Lq7Dym99iDx_vjj9rXRSBw4s-9Z98V2TpGEbI","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1717096529394?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=DdY3SKkpUrFYhULHMAP-K7RqY8Jf790yCt2O4OQ2Hhw","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1717096529394?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=ku7WzicMR3yDsPC4GMMUCHASbV13I20oW1CZDrfgDQk","height":800},{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1717096529394?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=n8DCK5f4ncgq31TcE-3UfG3meiI7KaouCBnbIKC8jeA","height":100}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5603AQEVd5sXVnbu8g\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[{"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlT8yoB--yku6Fbh9ldzHpeQI_dVNyEvX8,NAME_SEARCH,1098)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlTc-oB0hZmpnCwYZahTl8cpq6GZMvicgE,NAME_SEARCH,zX8V)"}],"description":"The short term objective: \nPartner with colleges to help passionate future leaders get the spiritual and educational support that will encourage them to seek a career in ministry in The United Methodist Church.\n\nThe long term objective:\nTo develop a sustainable ministry model for Urban Youth Outreach that can be implemented at District and Conference levels as well as the United Methodist Church at large. \u2003\n","title":"Operation Teen Rescue","startedOn":{"month":10,"year":2012}},{"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlT8yoB--yku6Fbh9ldzHpeQI_dVNyEvX8,NAME_SEARCH,1098)"}],"description":"Not in My Backyard: Landlocked by Racial Borders - Jim Crow Housing Policies in Fort Smith, Arkansas\n\r\nPresented by Vini Scott\n\r\nNimbyism is a catchphrase used to describe the phenomenon of \u201cwhite flight\u201d in a post-civil rights era.

Although the struggle for integration in Fort Smith was quiet, it was by no means without incident. This historic journey began with the Supreme Court order to integrate in 1954 and unofficially ended when the first two black students attended Southside High School in 1974.\n\nUnlike the highly publicized desegregation battles fought in other Arkansas cities, desegregation in Fort Smith was managed by an oligarchy of bureaucrats who manipulated school zones and new school construction to maintain de facto segregation for twenty years. During this time an epic legal battle was fought between the NAACP and the Special School District of Fort Smith that culminated in the United States Supreme Court, signaling the beginning of the end for Jim Crow in Arkansas' second largest city.","title":"2018  UAFS Undergraduate Symposium","startedOn":{"month":4,"year":2018},"url":"https:\/\/uafs.edu\/about\/uafs-student-research-symposium"}],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Mental Health Care","educations":[{"endedOn":{"month":5,"year":2024},"degree":"Master of Social Work -
