Mitigating many issues related to Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6 provides the feature of Route Optimization and mobility to Mobile Nodes (MN), which enhances the network performance and solve the mobility related issues. But as a result, it created many security related issues. The primary challenge of Mobile IPv6 is to provide security to end-users. The major contribution of this project is to design a new mitigation scheme for a Binding Drop attack in Mobile IPv6. We created a security framework in C, where we implemented a security algorithm and a key sharing scheme to protect the Binding Messages.
