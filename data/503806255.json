{"summary":"Human Biologist with experience in the field of drug safety and pharmacovigilance in clinical research. What I value the most of my job is the possibility to have an overview of the whole drug development process from preclinical stages until they reach the market. I am keen about health sciences and translational research and for me, being part of it, is already a success, as it allows me to contribute my bit to the process of generating new drugs to improve patients' lives. However, the world around you never stops so you must keep moving. For that reason, my aim is to keep growing in all aspects, both personally and professionally.","lastName":"Mateo Mohedano","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:503806255","geoRegion":"Catalonia, Spain","fullName":"Carla Mateo Mohedano","firstName":"Carla","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"AstraZeneca","description":"Currently working in Oncology Therapeutic Area, specifically within the scope of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) in monotherapy and combination regimens.

My presentation entitled \u201cUnravelling the complexity of signal detection and risk assessments in the Oncology Therapeutic Area\u201d focused on which are the main challenges of Oncology vs other Therapeutic Areas, providing some useful insights on how to address them. Particularly, in signal detection and risk assessment in the combination setting, where I shared some insights of a recent publication made by some AZ peers on a novel structured science-based methodology framework for the assessment of Combination Safety Risks in Clinical Trials. I really enjoyed the experience and the feedback received by the audience! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nIn addition, these two days were full of learnings from the presentations held such as: how companies are implementing novel tools to enhance efficiency in PV procedures (e.g. Dynamic visualizations, AI\u2026),\u00a0some novel initiatives on how to deal with RWE for decision making in safety and efficacy landscapes such as DARWIN EU, as well as evolving approaches to understand benefit-risk in a patient-centric manner, among others.\n\nI even learned some curiosities such as the fact that \u201cthe term computer used to refer to people whose job it was to perform mathematical calculations\u201d! \u2049 \n\nThanks Vita Svadeba for granting me with this opportunity as well as to all the presenters for all the learnings and good discussions I take with me!
