{"summary":"The way we treat cancer is changing with new treatments that offer targeted therapies and combination regimens to include immunotherapy.  This makes it an exciting time in the oncology pharmacy world as the pharmacist\u2019s role continues to expand to a more collaborative model with an increase in medication management. \n\nAs the Enloe Regional Cancer Center Pharmacy Manager, I enjoy building relationships with health care professionals, promoting drug safety and appropriateness, maximizing technology efficiency, budgeting, and evaluating new drug therapies for formulary consideration all to provide the best patient care.  \n\nOne of the greatest aspects of my job is working with my pharmacy team members.  There is a high since of camaraderie within the department that allows us to work hard and have fun while doing it.  Work without fun is just work! \n\nEnloe Health is in the process of building a new Regional Cancer Center that projects to open its doors in early 2026.  My involvement includes designing the infusion pharmacy and collaborating with other departments for workflow efficiency.
