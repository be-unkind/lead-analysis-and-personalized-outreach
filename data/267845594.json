Importantly, the expression of a wound-like cytokine response within the tumour is clinically associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. We show that co-expression of FAP and HO-1 in macrophages results from an innate early regenerative response driven by IL-6, which both directly regulates HO-1 expression and licenses FAP expression in a skin-like collagen-rich environment.

Folate Receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) is a central mediator of cell growth regulation that could serve as an important target for cancer therapy. Experimental Design: We evaluated FR\u03b1 expression in breast cancers by genomic (N = 3414) and immunohistochemical (N = 323) analyses and its association with clinical parameters and outcomes. We measured the functional contributions of FR\u03b1 in TNBC biology by RNA interference and the anti-tumor functions of an antibody recognizing FR\u03b1 (MOv18-IgG1), in vitro and in human TNBC xenograft models. Results: FR\u03b1 is overexpressed in significant proportions of aggressive basal like\/TNBC tumors, and in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy-residual disease associated with a high risk of relapse. Expression is associated with worse overall survival. TNBCs show dysregulated expression of thymidylate synthase, folate hydrolase 1 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, involved in folate metabolism. RNA interference to deplete FR\u03b1 decreased Src and ERK signaling and resulted in reduction of cell growth. An anti-FR\u03b1 antibody (MOv18-IgG1) conjugated with a Src inhibitor significantly restricted TNBC xenograft growth. Moreover, MOv18-IgG1 triggered immune-dependent cancer cell death in vitro by human volunteer and breast cancer patient immune cells, and significantly restricted orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft growth. Conclusions: FR\u03b1 is overexpressed in high-grade TNBC and post-chemotherapy residual tumors. It participates in cancer cell signaling and presents a promising target for therapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates, or passive immunotherapy priming Fc-mediated anti-tumor immune cell responses.\n\n","url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2018\/08\/01\/1078-0432.CCR-18-0652","name":"Anti-Folate Receptor alpha-directed Antibody Therapies Restrict the Growth of Triple Negative Breast Cancer","publisher":"Clinical Cancer Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_2_9oB2nZGmf6Iy40qftQA40StGEnPUmg,NAME_SEARCH,B8_e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":17,"year":2019},"description":"Cytotoxic chemotherapeutics (CCTs) are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Although their mechanisms of action have been best understood in terms of targeting the apparatus of mitosis, an ability to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses is increasing the recognition of these agents as immunotherapies. Immune checkpoint blockade antibodies neutralize important, but specific, immune-regulatory interactions such as PD-1\/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 to improve the anti-tumor immune response. However, CCTs can provide a broad-acting immune-stimulus against cancer, promoting both T-cell priming and recruitment to the tumor, which compliments the effects of immune checkpoint blockade. A key pathway in this process is \u201cimmunogenic cell death\u201d (ICD) which occurs as a result of tumor cell endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis elicited by CCTs. ICD involves a series of non-redundant signaling events which break tolerance and license anti-tumor antigen-specific T-cells, allowing CCTs to act as \u201cin situ\u201d tumor vaccination tools. Not all responses are tumor cell-intrinsic, as CCTs can also modulate the broader tumor microenvironment. This modulation occurs through preferential depletion of stromal cells which suppress and neutralize robust anti-tumor immune responses, such as myeloid cell populations and Tregs, while effector CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells and NK cells are relatively spared. The immune-stimulating effects of CCTs are dependent on chemotherapy class, dose and tumor cell sensitivity to the agent, highlighting the need to understand the underlying biology of these responses. This mini review considers the immune-stimulating effects of CCTs from a molecular perspective, specifically highlighting considerations for their utilization in the context of combinations with immunotherapy.","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fimmu.2019.01654\/full","name":"Cytotoxic Chemotherapy as an Immune Stimulus: A Molecular Perspective on Turning Up the Immunological Heat on Cancer","publisher":"Fontiers in Immunology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_2_9oB2nZGmf6Iy40qftQA40StGEnPUmg,NAME_SEARCH,B8_e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":20,"year":2021},"description":"Utilizing T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to identify and attack solid tumors has proven challenging, in large part because of the lack of tumor-specific targets to direct CAR binding.

This study presents a stringent hypoxia-sensing CAR T cell system that achieves selective expression of a pan-ErbB-targeted CAR within a solid tumor, a microenvironment characterized by inadequate oxygen supply. Using murine xenograft models, we demonstrate that, despite widespread expression of ErbB receptors in healthy organs, the approach provides anti-tumor efficacy without off-tumor toxicity.
