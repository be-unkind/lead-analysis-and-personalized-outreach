My Son was involved in a fatal car accident while leaving work 05-04-2024. He was an employee working for Austin industrial on nights. This has left me with some unexpected expenses. We came from Brazil with nothing, became citizen through the correct channels. The goal is to return him to Brazil where he was born and has family. Please disregard if I am out of line.\nThank you.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/gCXDJxMP"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7195479178756988928"}}}]}
