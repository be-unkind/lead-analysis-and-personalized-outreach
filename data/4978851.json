Months and years apart for the duration of the Afghan conflict.  Until 3 years ago on this day 8 March 2021, my husband of 17 years, Colonel Nick Carrell, died from a rapid and aggressive form of brain cancer, whilst still serving.\n\nIt was then I realised that I didn\u2019t know everything about being an army spouse. I didn\u2019t know that we had 93 days to vacate our home, that my children would soon become ineligible for their eductional bursaries, that my VO would be permitted to support my devastated little family for just six weeks, as they had other more important things for her to do elsewhere ..\n\nI learned that after two weeks, no one from the MoD calls, that they think when they\u2019re handed you a purple pack and an indecent pension that they have \u201cextracted from the bereaved family as clinically as possible \u201c , their words not  mine.  I learned that no one talks about transition for the spouse or breakfast clubs or drop ins. And for our bereaved children they lose their home, their school, their identity and their parent. \n\nWe had to leave the community we\u2019d lived in for almost 2 decades - were we still armed forces ? No, we\u2019re not serving. Were we veterans ? No we never served.\n\nSo who are we ? We\u2019re adrift and so are so many other military bereaved families.\n\nI am working to change the narrative around our military bereaved, to bring together the families, the MoD, the armed forces charity sector, the NHS and other support pathways because we must do better for families who have lost their loved ones whilst serving this country .\n\nThis was our last homecoming. Nick had been in Kabul for 8 months with no R&R.\n\nPlease help me to spread the word to help raise awareness in galvanising better support to the military bereaved community and in bringing about systemic change in the space that the armed forces community gives to families like mine.
