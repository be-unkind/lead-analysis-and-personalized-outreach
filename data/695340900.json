{"summary":"As a veterinarian with more than 10 years of experience in preclinical translational research, I specialize in pharmaceutical in vivo studies focused on oncology. I hold a DVM, an MS degree in veterinary biochemistry and toxicology, and a Ph.D. in health sciences and technology from the Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology (SAIHST).\n\nDuring my time as a team leader for preclinical translational research at Samsung Medical Center (SMC), my primary focus was on oncology target discovery. I studied tumor progression mechanisms, including EGFR, cMET, VEGF, and microRNAs, to identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. I also conducted research on miRNA-based therapy and identified therapeutic targets such as miR10b and miR29b. Additionally, I conducted efficacy studies using an orthotopic brain tumor model and a brain metastasis model, utilizing intracarotid artery and left ventricle injection methods to study brain and brain metastasis tumor.\n\nFurthermore, I established over 1000 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (e.g. GBM, colorectal, gastric, and lung cancer) and built a spheroid culture-based PDC library from cancer patients. I screened a novel cancer target using the PDX\/PDCs library and collaborated with major companies and institutions such as Roche, Merck, Regulus Therapeutics, Nexgenix, Weizmann Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, GC-Mogam, Yuhan, ILDONG, Samsung, and Ablbio.\n\nCurrently, I serve as a project leader for an immuno-oncology program at KANAPH Therapeutics Inc. My responsibilities include conducting in vivo efficacy studies, pharmacokinetic analysis, and non-GLP and GLP toxicology studies for small molecule and biologics programs. Additionally, I established a preclinical translational research center and am managing the team for preclinical studies. I have also been involved in due diligence (DD) and out-licensing (L\/O) activities.","lastName":"Kim","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:695340900","geoRegion":"Seoul, South Korea","fullName":"Donggeon

Our goal was to assess the expression of ADC targets and potential downstream determining factors of activity across pan-cancer and normal tissues. ADCs in clinical trials (n\u00a0=\u00a0121) were identified through ClinicalTrials.gov, corresponding to 54 targets. Genes potentially implicated in treatment response were identified in the literature. Gene expression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (9000+ cancers of 31 cancer types), the Genotype-Tissue Expression database (n\u00a0=\u00a019,000 samples from 31 normal tissue types), and the TNMplot.com (n\u00a0=\u00a012,494 unmatched primary and metastatic samples) were used in this analysis. To compare relative expression across and within tumour types we used pooled normal tissues as reference. For most ADC targets, mRNA levels correlated with protein expression. Pan-cancer target expression distributions identified appealing cancer types for each ADC development. Co-expression of multiple targets was common and suggested opportunities for ADC combinations. Expression levels of genes potentially implicated in ADC response downstream of the target might provide additional information (e.g. TOP1 was highly expressed in many tumour types, including breast and lung cancers). Metastatic compared to primary tissues overexpressed some ADCs targets.

Whilst some tumors, known as immune deserts, lack T cell infiltration due to the absence of suitable antigens or defects in antigen presentation, other so-called immune restricted tumors utilize a combination of suppressive mechanisms in order to grow and metastasize 2 . These include recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells 3 and\/or regulatory T cells as well as upregulation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and molecules including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 4 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) 5 . It is also clear that structurally abnormal vasculature play an important role in restricting T cell infiltration by creating localized regions with low blood flow and hypoxia 6 . Absence of adhesion and immununomodulatory molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) 7 and upregulation of PD-L1 8 and Fas ligand 9 on endothelial cells can each inhibit T cell transmigration into the tumor parenchyma. As such, therapeutic interventions that allow T cell to ignore these signals represent an important unmet clinical need. The cell-guidance systems normally associated with development have also been observed to affect leukocyte migration 10 , 11 , 12 . The secreted protein semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A) is known to guide both endothelial cells and neurons during embryogenesis through the cell-surface receptor family Plexin-A 13 , 14 . SEMA3A binding to Plexin-A requires the co-receptor NRP1 15 , 16 , which is found on CD4 + regulatory T cells (Treg cells) 17 , 18 and tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells 19 , 20 . In axonal growth cones, SEMA3A signaling leads to profound changes in filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeletal organization 21 , an effect that is thought to be dependent on myosin-IIA activity 22 . SEMA3A can also be produced by cancer cells 23 and recent evidence indicates that NRP1, like PD-1, is upregulated on dysfunctional tumor-specific CD8 + T cells and can modulate their anti-tumor response 19 , 24 , 25 , 26 . However, it remains contentious whether the SEMA3A-NRP1 axis is immunosuppressive 23 , 27 or supportive of CD8 + T cells\u2019 response to tumors 28 . Furthermore, due to the anti-angiogenic effects of SEMA3A 29 , several groups have proposed utilizing SEMA3A to inhibit tumor growth 28 , 30 . We therefore decided to examine the role of SEMA3A in anti-tumor immunity more closely. In this study, we report that NRP1 and Plexin-A1 and Plexin-A4 are upregulated following activation of CD8 + T cells corresponding to the level of TCR stimulation. Using T-cell-specific NRP1 knockout (KO) mice and genetic models of SEMA3A in cancer cells, we show that T cell expression of NRP1 and tumor cell expression of SEMA3A controls CD8 + T cell infiltration. We find SEMA3A expression in both cancer cells and blood and lymphatic endothelial cells within the TME. In vivo and in vitro experiments show that SEMA3A can strongly affect CD8 + T cell movement and migration, and formation of the immunological synapse, by paralyzing CD8 + T cells\u2019 F-actin cytoskeleton. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients we find that NRP1 + T cells often express PD-1 and are trapped in SEMA3A-rich areas. Taken together, our study implicates a form of immune inhibition utilized by tumors, namely by directly affecting the cytoskeleton of tumor-infiltrating T cells.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-024-47424-z","title":"Semaphorin 3A causes immune suppression by inducing cytoskeletal paralysis in tumour-specific CD8+ T cells - Nature Communications","sourceDomain":"nature.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":19}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7184550771282112512","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7184550771282112512","reactionsCount":19,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7184550770782912512","message":{"attributes":[{"start":25,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/df8bvDkb"}}}],"text":"Semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A) \n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/df8bvDkb\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7184550770782912512"}}},{"createdAt":1712577300000,"insightId":"fc249b0d-2b23-427b-8ad7-b45465f39e44","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQEdnJWlpIGhcg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712415822644?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=LNzbEDpH8_CQY5pGPPEwSVJmtMMdeNq2KkAlBSoOhYg","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQEdnJWlpIGhcg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712415822644?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=LNzbEDpH8_CQY5pGPPEwSVJmtMMdeNq2KkAlBSoOhYg"}]},"publishedAt":1712361600000,"description":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a dominant cell type in the stroma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Fibroblast heterogeneity reflects subpopulations of CAFs, which can influence prognosis and treatment efficacy. We describe the subtypes of CAFs in NSCLC. Primary human NSCLC resections were assessed by flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence for markers of fibroblast activation which allowed identification of CAF subsets. Survival data were analysed for our NSCLC cohort consisting of 163 patients to understand prognostic significance of CAF subsets. We identified five CAF populations, termed CAF S1-S5. CAF-S5 represents a previously undescribed population, and express FAP and PDPN but lack the myofibroblast marker \u03b1SMA, whereas CAF-S1 populations express all three. CAF-S5 are spatially further from tumour regions then CAF-S1 and scRNA data demonstrate an inflammatory phenotype. The presence of CAF-S1 or CAF-S5 is correlated to worse survival outcome in NSCLC, despite curative resection, highlighting the prognostic importance of CAF subtypes in NSCLC. TCGA data suggest the predominance of CAF-S5 has a poor prognosis across several cancer types.

Inhibition of the Hippo pathway and subsequent increased TEAD transcriptional activity promote tumorigenesis or resistance to therapies in a wide variety of cancers, including malignant mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . These remain challenging cancers to treat, with limited targeted therapy options available. Although systemic chemotherapy and emerging KRAS-targeting therapies in NSCLC, PDAC and CRC as well as immunotherapy in NSCLC offer some benefit, they often fail to achieve durable responses, underscoring the need for alternative therapeutic modalities effective as a single agent or combination partner 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . TEAD transcriptional activity is dependent on protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) with cofactors, of which yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (WWTR1\/TAZ) are the two most important coactivators, and vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) is a prominent co-repressor. The YAP\/TAZ\u2013TEAD complex has recently become a druggable oncology target, with the first inhibitors being a variety of allosteric binders of the TEAD lipid pocket (LP) 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , whose binding prevents post-translational autopalmitoylation of a conserved internal cysteine that is essential for TEAD maturation and function 22 , 23 . Although these TEAD binders showed promising results in preclinical studies 17 , 21 , to date, the consequences of a direct pharmacological disruption of the YAP\u2013TEAD interface remain unexplored.

Herein, we describe the biological and preclinical characterization of IAG933 and its close analogs, their monotherapy activity in specific Hippo-dependent cancers and in combination with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), KRAS, BRAF, MEK or ERK inhibitors in a broad range of other cancer models.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s43018-024-00754-9","title":"Direct and selective pharmacological disruption of the YAP\u2013TEAD interface by IAG933 inhibits Hippo-dependent and RAS\u2013MAPK-altered cancers - Nature Cancer","sourceDomain":"nature.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":21}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7182197476169322498","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7182197476169322498","reactionsCount":21,"commentsCount":2,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7182197475695292416","message":{"attributes":[{"start":96,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gtqnfKpZ"}}}],"text":"IAG933 : a first-in-class and selective disruptors of the YAP\u2013TEAD protein\u2013protein interaction\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/gtqnfKpZ\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7182197475695292416"}}},{"createdAt":1712185500000,"insightId":"414d1b6c-4b28-4bb1-bfdb-cc1ab3bda88d","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQHZRl5_L379HQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712150597750?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=y-7fD7fGr5y8WEy4_cDstFsGANN7CldXqtVcXXXn1IM","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQHZRl5_L379HQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712150597750?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=y-7fD7fGr5y8WEy4_cDstFsGANN7CldXqtVcXXXn1IM"}]},"publishedAt":1712136862000,"description":"Genmab is mounting a $1.8 billion challenge against its close collaborator AbbVie. | Genmab is mounting a $1.8 billion challenge against its close collaborator AbbVie.

The Danish biotech is using the money to buy ProfoundBio and gain control of a midphase antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that could compete against AbbVie\u2019s Elahere. ProfoundBio\u2019s lead drug candidate is rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S), an ADC designed to deliver topoisomerase-1 (Topo1) inhibitor to cells that express folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1). FR\u03b1 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, leading companies including Bio-Thera Solutions, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eisai, ImmunoGen and Sutro Biopharma to aim ADCs at the receptor. ImmunoGen received accelerated approval for its FR\u03b1 drug, Elahere, in 2022 and went on to link it to improved overall survival. AbbVie responded by inking a $10.1 billion deal to buy ImmunoGen. The biotech reported quarterly U.S. Elahere sales of $105.2 million shortly before AbbVie made its move. Yet Genmab sees an opportunity to come from behind and establish Rina-S as a major drug, reflecting its belief that the molecule is a potential best-in-class asset. The Danish biotech is gambling $1.8 billion on that belief. Rina-S consists of a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds FR\u03b1, a novel cleavable hydrophilic linker and a Topo1 payload, exatecan. Preclinical tests found the hydrophilic linker gives better physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics than conventional linkers and showed Rina-S kills cancer cells in mouse models of multiple tumor types with high, moderate and low FR\u03b1 expression. ProfoundBio is testing Rina-S in the second part of a phase 1\/2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer and other FR\u03b1-expressing tumors. Genmab sees a future for the ADC in a range of FR\u03b1-expressing solid tumors. Buying ProfoundBio, which is headquartered in Seattle and has an R&D center in Suzhou, China, will also give Genmab control of a clutch of other candidates. ProfoundBio is developing ADCs that target CD70 and PTK7 plus a bispecific ADC that hits EGFR and cMET. Genmab contends the combination of its own antibody skills and ProfoundBio\u2019s platforms can potentially spawn additional drug candidates. In the past, Genmab sought out acquisitions that gave it tools and components to boost its research and discovery engine, not drug candidates, but the biotech has been open about a change in its strategy. Anthony Pagano, Genmab\u2019s chief financial officer, discussed the reasoning for the shift on an earnings call in February. \u201cOver the last couple of years, we've invested quite a bit to build out our mid- to late-stage development capabilities as well as our commercialization capability,\u201d Pagano said at the time. \u201cSo, we're looking to leverage those investments as we move forward. We're therefore pursuing potential [business development] and M&A opportunities that align with our core focus areas.\u201d Genmab CEO Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., used the same call in February to float the prospect of the company accelerating its expansion into immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases by acquiring a late-stage development or even commercial-stage candidate. In the end, Genmab stayed in its cancer stronghold for its first big pipeline deal.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.fiercebiotech.com\/biotech\/genmab-inks-18b-profoundbio-buyout-would-be-elahere-rival-teeing-scrap-adc-market","title":"Genmab inks $1.8B ProfoundBio buyout for would-be Elahere rival, teeing up scrap for ADC market","sourceDomain":"fiercebiotech.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":19}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7181426512087187458","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7181426512087187458","reactionsCount":19,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7181426511139254272","message":{"attributes":[{"start":808,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gTJ9a_RA"}}}],"text":"Genmab is acquiring ProfoundBio for $1.8 billion in cash to enter the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) market.

PANoptosis, a convergence of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, plays a crucial role in cell death and immune response regulation. The study...","fullText":"Numerous studies have consistently shown that controlling cell proliferation and removing unnecessary or potentially harmful cells is essential in maintaining homeostasis for the growth and development of multicellular organisms in vivo [ 1 ]. Programmed cell death (PCD) is an effective mechanism for regulating these processes, designed to actively sculpt, control, and aid in the development and survival of the body [ 2 ]. PCD encompasses both classical apoptosis within the context of developmental and tissue homeostasis, as well as alternative forms that arise in response to exogenous or endogenous microenvironment perturbations, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, and others [ 3 ]. The study of the most classical and well-defined PCD pathways of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, and most importantly, the interaction between these three pathways, has led to the establishment and development of the concept of \u2018PANoptosis\u2019. Evidence for PANoptosis was first provided in a study of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected macrophages, which demonstrated that activation of caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-8, as well as phosphorylation of MLKL, were key molecular events in pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis [ 4 ]. It is worth noting that PANoptosis has key features of the above pathways, but cannot be explained by any one of them alone. Rather, they are interconnected and maintain dynamical equilibrium by sharing a deadly protein complex, namely \u2018PANoptosome\u2019, which is thought to be a platform that can engage multiple modes of cell death [ 5 ]. As such, significant crosstalk occurs in the execution and regulation of the numerous pathways in PANoptosis. Recent studies have focused on the complex molecular mechanisms underlying PANoptosis and its implications in human diseases, particularly cancer [ 6 , 7 ]. The progression of cancer has been linked to mechanisms that allow cancer cells to bypass PANoptosis. Therefore, understanding the connection between PANoptosis and cancer may provide deeper insights into the occurrence and treatment of cancer, and may be critical in exploring new therapeutic strategies by interfering with the escape mechanism of PANoptosis in cancer cells.

Copper directly associates with the lipoylated proteins of the...","fullText":"Copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes and it is required for biological processes\u2014including oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, iron homeostasis, connective tissue cross-linking, and signal transmission\u2014in almost all organisms [ 1 , 2 ]. Copper deficiency is associated with a wide range of genetic, neurological, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases [ 3 , 4 ]. However, beyond the threshold maintained by an evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism, copper ions can become toxic [ 5 ]. Several copper ionophores, such as elesclomol and disulfiram, were found to promote copper-dependent regulated cell death (RCD), namely cuproptosis, in cells with high rates of oxidative phosphorylation [ 6 ]. However, it remained unclear how excessive copper induces cell death until Tsvetkov et al. revealed that copper directly targets lipoylated proteins of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to induce cuproptosis [ 7 ]. Tsvetkov et al. [ 7 ] investigated whether copper is required for elesclomol-induced cell death. As serum is the main source of copper for cultured cells, withdrawal of serum from the culture medium increased the resistance of cells to elesclomol. In contrast, supplementation with copper ions in the culture medium dramatically sensitized cells to elesclomol. In addition to elesclomol, a panel of copper ionophores, such as disulfiram and NSC319726, also induced cell death in the presence of copper, whereas the addition of other metals, including iron, cobalt, zinc, and nickel, did not affect this type of cell death. Copper chelators were also included in this study to verify the importance of copper in this process. Indeed, depletion of the endogenous copper chelator glutathione (GSH) promoted, while the addition of the exogenous copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate repressed, elesclomol-induced cell death. Further studies have shown that copper ionophore-induced cell death cannot be remediated by inhibitors of apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, or oxidative stress. Together, these results suggest that copper-dependent cell death, termed cuproptosis [ 6 ], differs from other known types of cell death. In addition, it was found that cells addicted to mitochondrial metabolism are more sensitive to copper ionophores than those using glycolysis as the main source of energy [ 7 ]. Consistently, treatment of cells with inhibitors of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC) or mitochondrial pyruvate uptake alleviated cuproptosis induced by elesclomol. The mitochondrial uncoupling agent, FCCP, which reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP biogenesis, did not affect cuproptosis, suggesting that ATP production is not required for this process. Cells grown under hypoxic conditions were resistant to cuproptosis, but forced activation of the HIF pathway alone did not affect cuproptosis of cells under normoxic conditions, again underscoring the important role of mitochondrial respiration in mediating copper-induced cell death. Interestingly, elesclomol dramatically reduced the spare capacity of respiration but not basal or ATP-linked respiration. These results indicate that elesclomol-copper may directly target the components of the TCA cycle without affecting ETC activity and ATP synthesis. To elucidate the mechanistic basis underlying cuproptosis, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening was performed [ 7 ]. Seven genes have been identified as regulators of cuproptosis. Among them, FDX1 encodes a reductase that converts Cu 2+ to Cu + which is a more cytotoxic form of copper; LIPT1 , LIAS , and DLD encode the components of the lipoic acid pathway; and DLAT , PDHA1 , and PDHB encode the lipoylated components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, suggesting that the lipoic acid pathway and protein lipoylation may be important for cuproptosis. Interestingly, copper was found to directly bind to lipoylated TCA cycle proteins, leading to disulfide-bond-dependent aggregation of these proteins and degradation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins. More importantly, FDX1 was considered a central regulator of cuproptosis, because FDX1 depletion led to complete loss of protein lipoylation, marked decrease in cellular respiration, accumulation of pyruvate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, reduction of succinate, and stabilization of Fe-S cluster proteins. Altogether, excessive copper promotes aggregation of lipoylated TCA cycle proteins and destabilization of Fe-S cluster proteins, both of which are mediated by FDX1, consequently resulting in cuproptosis. Finally, the authors investigated the effects of intracellular copper fluctuation on cuproptosis by experimentally manipulating the genes encoding the copper importer SLC31A1 and exporter ATP7B in vitro and in vivo [ 7 ]. Overexpression of SLC31A1 in cells dramatically increased their sensitivity to CuCl 2 -induced aggregation of lipoylated proteins and degradation of Fe-S cluster proteins. Consistently, SLC31A1-sensitized, copper-induced cell death was partially rescued by copper chelators and depletion of FDX1 or LIAS. Remarkably, these in vitro findings were further validated in a Wilson\u2019s disease mouse model with Atp7b depletion ( Atp7b \u2212\/\u2212 ). Compared with the livers of Atp7b +\/\u2212 and wild-type mice, those of Atp7b \u2212\/\u2212 mice showed significant loss of lipoylated and Fe-S cluster proteins, demonstrating that accumulation of intracellular copper leads to cuproptosis in vivo. Collectively, the study reported by Tsvetkov et al. [ 7 ] provides mechanistic insight into cuproptosis and suggests an important role for copper homeostasis in human diseases, including cancer. However, numerous questions remain regarding this understudied field. Is there a threshold for the copper concentration in a cell to induce cuproptosis? Does cuproptosis respond to or is it regulated by cellular stress signals? How do energy metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and Fe-S cluster metabolism, coordinate with cuproptosis in cancer? Could modulating the copper-induced cell death be exploited for the development of new anti-cancer therapies? These questions warrant further investigation.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41418-023-01125-0","title":"Cuproptosis: p53-regulated metabolic cell death? - Cell Death & Differentiation","sourceDomain":"nature.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":24},{"type":"INTEREST","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7175445010161496064","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7175445010161496064","reactionsCount":25,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7175445009662402560","message":{"attributes":[{"start":177,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gdpGKmvC"}}}],"text":"Cuproptosis is a novel type of copper-induced cell death that primarily occurs in cells that utilize oxidative phosphorylation as the main metabolic pathway to produce energy.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/gdpGKmvC\n\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7175445009662402560"}}},{"createdAt":1710625860000,"insightId":"197a2e18-e3a3-4f38-827d-454a822a9372","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQGgjQyZhoWwWA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711503937072?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=AtRThOQWXYPnUg0Iu0O5Sx9LryHoXud8bnmoTNP-9DU","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQGgjQyZhoWwWA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711503937072?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=AtRThOQWXYPnUg0Iu0O5Sx9LryHoXud8bnmoTNP-9DU"}]},"description":"Bispecific antibody\u2012drug conjugates (BsADCs) represent an innovative therapeutic category amalgamating the merits of antibody\u2012drug conjugates (ADCs) a\u2026","fullText":"Bispecific antibody\u2012drug conjugates (BsADCs) represent an innovative therapeutic category amalgamating the merits of antibody\u2012drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs).

Here the authors report the characterization of a CEACAM6-targeting antibody drug conjugate loaded with a BET protein degrader, showing antitumour activity in PDAC...","fullText":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a common type of pancreatic cancer, is usually diagnosed at advanced stages (stage III, about 20%; stage IV, about 50%). Most treatment options are ineffective, resulting in 10% survival for all stages and 3% survival for stage IV at 5 years in the United States 1 . Predictions of cancer incidence and deaths suggests that deaths from pancreatic cancer will increase continuously, and pancreatic cancer will become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US by 2030 2 , 3 . One of the promising classes of highly potent modalities is antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) 4 , in which an antibody is conjugated to a small compound known as the payload. The combination of high selectivity and stability of the antibodies with high cell-killing activity of the payload enables specific killing of malignant cancer cells. Another key element of ADCs is the \u201cbystander effect,\u201d namely the effect of diffused payloads, after targeted delivery, on surrounding cancer or stromal cells lacking target expression 5 . This effect might be crucial to the fight against PDAC, because tumor heterogeneity has an impact on the prognosis 6 . Despite the increasing role of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer treatment, current options are very limited. For neoadjuvant chemotherapy and first- and second-line chemotherapy, gemcitabine (GEM) + nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX), and FOLFIRINOX or modified FOLFIRINOX regimens are recommended in National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (NCCN Guidelines\u00ae). For adjuvant chemotherapy, S-1 (only in Japan), GEM + capecitabine, and modified FOLFIRINOX regimens are recommended. Cisplatin followed by olaparib, larotrectinib or entrectinib, and pembrolizumab are recommended for BRCA1\/2- or PALB2-mutated cancers, NTRK gene-fusion-positive cancers, and MSI-H\/dMMR cancers respectively. Liposomal irinotecan is recommended as a second line after GEM-based therapy. For later lines, best supportive care is recommended. Therefore, there are largely only three options for most PDAC patients: GEM-based, 5FU-based, or irinotecan (SN38)-based chemotherapy. Over the past decade, several bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors have entered clinical trials against various solid tumors and haematological malignancies. However, the efficacy of these inhibitors has been very limited due to severe drug-related toxicities 7 . For clinical application of BET modulators, a specific delivery system to tumors would be necessary. In this study, we identify BET protein degrader 8 , 9 EBET as a payload candidate for PDAC. As a target for the ADC, we select carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6, also known as CD66c) and develop an antibody, #84.7. EBET-conjugated #84.7 (84-EBET) induces marked tumor regression in various PDAC-patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and has a combined effect with standard chemotherapy or programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody without substantial toxicity.

For a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the molecular pathways and intricate mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, we recommend referring to several recent reviews in the field. 12 , 24 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 PUFAs are highly prone to lipid peroxidation due to the presence of weak C-H bonds at the bis-allylic positions. 44 , 65 Recent studies mainly focus on \u03c9-6 PUFAs, such as linoleic acid (18:2), gamma-linolenic acid (18:3), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3), AA (20:4) and AdA (22:4), as well as \u03c9-3 PUFAs, including alpha-linolenic acid (18:3), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). 66 , 67 Among them, AA (20:4) and AdA (22:4), are the primary substrates of lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis. 68 Notably, free PUFAs are not the direct drivers of ferroptosis, and they need to be esterified into membrane PLs to exhibit lethality after peroxidation. 46 , 68 , 69 ACSL4 and LPCAT3 are responsible for the biosynthesis and esterification of PUFA-PLs. Taking AA (20:4) as a case in point, ACSL4 catalyzes the combination of free AA (20:4) and CoA to form a CoA-AA (20:4) intermediate, which is subsequently esterified into PEs by LPCAT3 to generate AA (20:4)-PE (PE-AA), 46 , 68 , 69 which are necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Consistently, malonyl-CoA generated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-catalyzed carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is critical for the synthesis of certain PUFAs and is therefore necessary for ferroptosis. 60 The peroxisome-mediated biosynthesis of plasmalogens has been suggested as an additional pathway for the production of PUFAs involved in lipid peroxidation, favoring ferroptosis onset. 52 , 70 On the contrary, phospholipase A2 group VI (iPLA2\u03b2) cleaves oxidized PUFA tails from PLs to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis. 71 Remarkedly, deuterated PUFAs (D-PUFAs) at bis-allylic position retards the radical chain reaction of lipid peroxidation to protect against RSL3- or erastin-induced ferroptosis, 44 suggesting the significance of the structure of PUFAs in its activity. Lipid peroxidation is the hallmark of ferroptosis. 4 PUFA-PLs are highly susceptible to peroxidation because of the presence of bis-allylic moieties in PUFAs. The oxidation of PUFA-PLs occurs through both enzymatic reactions and non-enzymatic autoxidation driven by the Fenton reaction. 44 , 72 Enzymatic lipid peroxidation of PUFA-PLs primarily involves the action of ALOXs and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). 73 ALOXs are enzymes containing nonheme iron, which directly introduce oxygen to PUFAs and PUFA-containing lipids within biological membranes. For example, ALOX12 is essential for p53-dependent ferroptosis, while ALOX15 is involved in erastin- or RSL3-induced ferroptosis through complexing with PE binding protein 1 (PEBP1), specifically recognizing stearoyl-AA-PE to generate lipid peroxides. 74 Moreover, ALOXE3, ALOX5, ALOX12B, and ALOX15B have been implicated in ferroptosis induction. 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 Several ALOX inhibitors have been shown to possess antioxidant properties, effectively shielding cells from lipid peroxidation. 35 , 42 However, genetic deletion of Alox15 in Gpx4 knockout mice failed to avert ferroptosis in vivo, 8 and Alox12\/15 failed to restore the viability of Gpx4 deficient T cells, 79 suggesting the existence of alternative mechanisms in certain contexts of ferroptosis. As expected, POR directly supplies electrons to the P450 enzyme, which catalyzes the peroxidation of PUFA-PLs in an ALOX-independent manner. 73 , 80 These studies suggested that several iron-dependent enzymes can promote lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Future investigations are needed to determine the potential involvement of other oxygenases, such as cyclooxygenases and peroxygenases, in lipid peroxidation. Non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation of PUFA-PLs is driven by the Fenton reaction, with iron serving as a catalyst. 72 , 81 In this process, once the initial phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOHs) are generated (via enzymatic reactions or other cellular metabolic processes) and are not promptly reduced by GPX4, they can interact with ferrous iron to yield alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals (Fenton reaction), initiating PLOOHs production. 82 , 83 As noted above, lipid peroxidation requires both iron-dependent enzymes and iron-mediated Fenton reactions, thereby at least partly providing the iron-dependent nature of ferroptosis. Thus, interventions targeting iron metabolism have an impact on the vulnerability to ferroptosis. Ferric iron is the primary form of iron in circulation and binds to transferrin (TF). 84 It is delivered into cells and localized in endosomes with the assistance of TFR1, a membrane protein. 85 Within the endosome, ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron by the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3). 86 The endocytosed ferrous iron is later released into the cytoplasm via solute carrier family 11 member 2 (SLC11A2), forming the labile iron pool (LIP), which catalyzes the generation of hydroxyl radicals and triggers ferroptosis. 87 Excess intracellular iron is typically sequestered within the ferritin protein, which consists of two subunits: ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and ferritin light chain (FTL). 41 Ferritin undergoes degradation via ferritinophagy, facilitated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), resulting in the release of substantial amounts of iron. 88 , 89 Additionally, excess cytoplasmic ferrous iron can be exported from the cell through solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1). 90 Consistently, deletion of TF, TFR1, SLC11A2 and NCOA1, and overexpression of FTH1, FTL and SLC40A1 suppresses ferroptosis by decreasing the LIP. 91 Therefore, interventions that modulate the import, storage, and export of iron in the cytoplasm contribute to an increase in susceptibility to ferroptosis. In addition to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, which is the primary site of iron utilization and the main source of ROS, plays a major role in modulating redox-active reactions and ferroptosis. 92 , 93 To reach the mitochondria, iron must traverse both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes to enter the matrix through SLC11A2, 94 and solute carrier family 25 member 37 (SLC25A37) or solute carrier family 25 member 28 (SLC25A28), respectively. 95 , 96 , 97 Moreover, recent studies highlighted the key role of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1 (CISD1) in regulating iron homeostasis in mitochondria. 98 , 99 CISD1 knockdown significantly increases the content of erastin-induced mitochondrial ferrous irons and promotes mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. 100 CISD1 can also bind with VDAC proteins and regulate their gating in a redox-dependent manner. 101 Inhibiting VDAC proteins can prevent mitoCISD1-dependent mitochondrial iron accumulation and erastin-induced ferroptosis. 40 , 101 , 102 , 103 Ferritin mitochondrial (FTMT) serves as the iron-storage protein in mitochondria, inhibiting ferroptosis by reducing total and chelatable iron levels. 104 , 105 , 106 ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 7 (ABCB7) is involved in the transfer of iron from mitochondria to cytosol. 107 , 108 , 109 Although mitochondrial iron accumulation can be observed in the absence of ABCB7, 107 ABCB7 loss does not lead to an increase in mitochondrial ROS and ferroptosis. 110 On the contrary, ABCB8 can facilitate mitochondrial iron export. 111 , 112 Overexpression of ABCB8 reduces mitochondrial iron and protects against ferroptosis-related I\/R damage and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. 113 , 114 Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that diverse factors controlling iron metabolism regulate susceptibility to ferroptosis. Erastin and RSL3 are the representative two types of ferroptosis inducers (FINs) through directly inhibiting the activity of xc - system and GPX4, respectively. 4 , 43 The system xc - containing subunits SLC7A11 and solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) mediates the exchanges of intracellular glutamate for extracellular cystine. 115 , 116 Intracellular cystine is quickly converted to cysteine, playing a vital role as a cellular antioxidant and acting as the limiting factor for the synthesis of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL)-mediated GSH synthesis. 117 , 118 The availability of cellular GSH closely regulates the cellular GPX4 activity. 119 , 120 Thus, the inactivation of GPX4 by both erastin and RSL3, either directly or indirectly, underscores the significance of GPX4 as a key repressor of ferroptosis. GPX4 is the sole member of the GPX family that acts as a phospholipid hydroperoxidase, directly reducing PLOOH to their corresponding phospholipid alcohols (PLOH). 31 , 121 GPX4\u2019s catalytic reaction operates according to a ping-pong mechanism, where the enzyme\u2019s active site shuttles between oxidation and reduction states. Firstly, the PLOOH oxidizes the active site selenol in GPX4 (GPX4-SeH) to form the selenenic acid intermediate (GPX4-SeOH). Secondly, this intermediate undergoes a reaction with GSH, resulting in the formation of the selenium-glutathione adduct (GPX4-Se-SG). Thirdly, through a reaction with a second GSH molecule, GPX4-Se-SG undergoes conversion to GPX4-SeH, generating oxidized glutathione (GSSG). 122 , 123 By examining the crystal structure of seleno-GPX4, researchers observed the existence of seleninic acid (GPX4-Se-OO-) within the enzyme\u2019s active site. 124 This finding implies the possibility of an alternative reaction mechanism that encompasses three distinct redox states (GPX4-SeH, GPX4-SeOH, GPX4-Se-OO - ) of the catalytically active selenocysteine. These studies have also emphasized the essential role of selenocysteine in the expression and activity of GPX4, which is in line with Ingold et al.\u2019s findings that the substitution of a cysteine residue for selenocysteine (U46C) in GPX4 is required to prevent hydroperoxide-induced ferroptosis. 125 GPX4 exists in three isoforms: mitochondrial, cytosolic, and nuclear GPX4. While derived from the same GPX4 gene, the isoforms of GPX4 have distinct transcription initiation sites. 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 Early embryonic lethality occurs when the cytosolic GPX4 gene is genetically ablated or expresses an inactive form. 130 The rescue of the lethal phenotype in Gpx4-null mutant mice was achieved by re-expression of cytoplasmic GPX4, rather than mitochondrial or nuclear GPX4, indicating the crucial role of cytosolic GPX4 in preventing embryonic lethality. 131 , 132 Disruption of mitochondrial GPX4 in mice does not result in lethality but instead causes male infertility due to abnormal sperm development. 130 , 133 It seems that only cytosolic GPX4 could suppress ferroptosis, which is challenged by recent studies that mitochondrial GPX4, but not cytoplasmic GPX4, could potently suppress lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in DHODH or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GDP2) knockout cells. 134 , 135 Therefore, these organelle-specific forms of GPX4 may independently inhibit local lipid hydroperoxides and ferroptosis, although the potential role of nuclear GPX4 requires further investigation. Notably, GPX4 depletion also mediates apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis in mice, suggesting that GPX4 depletion-induced lipid peroxidation occupies a central position at the intersection of these forms of RCD. Thus, the detection of multiple markers is essential for definitively identifying ferroptosis in addition to lipid peroxidation. As mentioned above, GPX4 is a central suppressor of ferroptosis, and other mechanisms that regulate the activity or expression of GPX4 also control susceptibility to ferroptosis. 43 , 45 , 136 , 137 , 138 However, some cancer cells survived GPX4 inhibition, suggesting the existence of alternative mechanisms of ferroptosis resistance. In recent years, three GPX4-independent systems that capture free radicals to exert their antioxidative effects and suppress ferroptosis have been identified. These systems include FSP1\/ ubiquinol (CoQH 2 ), DHODH\/CoQH 2 , and GCH1\/BH4. Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an endogenous antioxidant and exists in three forms: CoQ 10 , semiquinone, and CoQH 2 , wherein CoQH 2 traps lipid peroxyl radicals to protect cells from ferroptosis. 15 , 49 The synthesis and cellular distribution of CoQ 10 are linked to StAR related lipid transfer domain containing 7 (STARD7), which transports CoQ 10 from mitochondria, where it is synthesized, to the plasma membrane. 139 In 2020, two independent teams found that N-myristylation-dependent recruitment of FSP1 to the plasma membrane resists ferroptosis in the plasma membrane. 48 , 49 , 140 Mechanistically, FSP1 suppresses lipid peroxidation by catalyzing the reduction of CoQ 10 to CoQH 2 with the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H). 48 Moreover, FSP1 was identified as a vitamin K reductase to generate its associated hydroquinone, which inhibits lipid peroxidation at the expense of NAD(P)H. 56 A recent study also suggested that phase separation of FSP1 plays a role in promoting ferroptosis which requires N-terminal myristoylation, as well as specific amino acid residues and essentially disordered, low-complexity regions in FSP1. 57 Analogous to the function of FSP1 in the plasma membranes, DHODH detoxifies lipid peroxides by reducing CoQ 10 to CoQH 2 , thereby inhibiting ferroptosis specifically in the mitochondria. 134 Furthermore, GCH1 has been identified as a suppressor of ferroptosis through a two-pronged mechanism. 48 , 50 On one hand, GCH1 produces the lipophilic antioxidant BH4 preventing lipid peroxidation; on the other hand, GCH1 induces lipid remodeling as a protective measure against ferroptosis by selectively safeguarding PLs with two polyunsaturated fatty acyl tails from depletion. 48 , 50 However, the subcellular compartments wherein the GCH1\/BH4 system functions still need further investigation. Different from PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are less susceptible to peroxidation owing to a lack of bis-allylic positions. Exogenous MUFAs can prevent ferroptosis by displacing PUFAs from membrane lipids. 44 , 141 The biosynthesis of anti-ferroptosis MUFA-PLs is mainly regulated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3). 141 , 142 SCD1 introduces a double bond in the cis-\u03949 position of the de novo synthesized saturated fatty acids (SFAs), particularly palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0), resulting in the formation of palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1), respectively. 142 As a result, overexpression of SCD1 enhances MUFA synthesis and protects cells from ferroptosis, while inhibition of SCD1 enhances the sensitivity to ferroptosis. 59 , 142 Moreover, MUFAs are reported to enhance both the number of lipid droplets and the number\/function of peroxisomes, leading to a reduction in ether lipids and lipid oxidation. 143 However, oleic acid does not lower the propensity of cells to succumb to ferroptosis in ACSL3-depleted cells. 54 ACSL3 converts MUFAs into their acyl-CoA esters, facilitating their incorporation into membrane PLs. 141 Thus, similar to PUFAs, MUFAs need to be inserted into the membrane to exhibit antioxidant properties. Interestingly, MBOAT1\/2 has recently been identified to selectively transfer MUFAs into lyso-PE, resulting in an increase in cellular PE-MUFA and a corresponding decrease in cellular PE-PUFA, ultimately resisting ferroptosis. 59 On all accounts, the anti-ferroptosis role of MBOAT1\/2 operates independently of GPX4 and FSP1 through a surveillance mechanism mediated by PL remodeling. The rupture of the plasma membrane is involved at the terminal stage of ferroptosis. Membrane damages in ferroptosis cover a loss of plasma membrane integrity, 88 and rupture of the outer mitochondria membrane. 4 , 8 Consequently, membrane repair systems have been proposed and demonstrated to prevent ferroptosis. Among these systems, the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) has gained attention as a common mechanism for membrane repair, acting as a defense against various forms of RCD, including ferroptosis. 144 , 145 , 146 Mechanistically, ferroptosis leads to an elevation in cytosolic Ca 2+ levels due to an osmotic imbalance triggered by the opening of small nanopores. 147 In response to the influx of Ca, 2+ subunits of ESCRT-III known as charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs), specifically CHMP5 and CHMP6, are recruited and assembled at the location of damage to facilitate membrane repair processes. Erastin and RSL3, which are known as ferroptosis activators, lead to the buildup of CHMP5 and CHMP6 in the plasma membrane of pancreatic cancer cells, and the knocking out of CHMP5 or CHMP6 intensifies the susceptibility of cancer cells to ferroptosis. 146 Furthermore, in certain cases, FSP1 inhibits ferroptosis by promoting the accumulation of CHMP5 and CHMP6 on the plasma membrane. 148 Overall, these findings highlight the critical role of ESCRT-III activation in preventing ferroptosis.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41392-024-01769-5","title":"Ferroptosis in cancer: From molecular mechanisms to therapeutic strategies - Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy","sourceDomain":"nature.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":60},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1},{"type":"INTEREST","count":6}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7172493324652589056","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7172493324652589056","reactionsCount":67,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7172493324061143040","message":{"attributes":[{"start":24,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gJN7AsNa"}}}],"text":"Ferroptosis in cancer.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/gJN7AsNa\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7172493324061143040"}}},{"createdAt":1709628900000,"insightId":"2f2af736-2709-445e-9ccf-364f82c2d461","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQFwTBX9YNxQ0A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711726058902?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=G4HBhVBqflg2cVDyTyrEFrcPxG_wBXlq6uso5sIHLyQ","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQFwTBX9YNxQ0A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711726058902?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=G4HBhVBqflg2cVDyTyrEFrcPxG_wBXlq6uso5sIHLyQ"}]},"publishedAt":1706140800000,"description":"Immune cell engagers \u2014 antibody-based molecules engineered to direct immune effector cells to recognize and kill cancer cells \u2014 represent a rapidly expanding approach in cancer therapy.
