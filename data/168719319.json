Finding meaning during these periods can be significant yet difficult. My work\u00a0at the Wilson Support Center, an affiliate of Hospice & Palliative Care Buffalo, is to personalize grief support for bereaved loved ones and the community at large. We hope to make it less complicated to access support, because we know it's already hard enough.","lastName":"VanDien, LCSW","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:168719319","geoRegion":"Buffalo-Niagara Falls Area","fullName":"Anna M.
