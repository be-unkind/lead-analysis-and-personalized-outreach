The antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) anti-endosialin-MC-VC-PABC-MMAE was selectively cytotoxic to endosialin-positive cells in vitro and achieved profound and durable antitumor efficacy in preclinical human tumor xenograft models of endosialin-positive disease. MC-VC-PABC-MMAE was conjugated with anti-endosialin with 3\u20134 MMAE molecules per ADC. The anti-endosialin-MC-VC-PABC-MMAE conjugate was tested for activity in four human cell lines with varied endosialin levels. The HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells do not express endosialin, A-673 Ewing sarcoma cells and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells are moderate expressers of endosialin, and SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cells express very high levels of endosialin. To determine whether endosialin expression was maintained in vivo, A-673 Ewing sarcoma, SK-N-AS neuroblastoma, and SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cells were grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice. The SK-N-AS neuroblastoma and the A-673 Ewing sarcoma lines were selected for in vivo efficacy testing of the anti-endosialin-MC-VC-PABC-MMAE conjugate. The treatment groups included a vehicle control, unconjugated anti-endosialin, an admix control consisting of anti-endosialin and a dose of free MMAE equivalent to the dose administered as the ADC, and the anti-endosialin-MC-VC-PABC-MMAE conjugate. The unconjugated anti-endosialin had no antitumor activity and resulted in similar tumor growth as the vehicle control. The admix control produced a modest tumor growth delay. Administration of the anti-endosialin-MC-VC-PABC-MMAE conjugate resulted in a marked prolonged tumor response of both xenografts. These proof-of-concept results break new ground and open a promising drug discovery approach to these rare and neglected tumors.","url":"http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/14\/9\/2081.long","name":"Anti-Endosialin Antibody\u2013Drug Conjugate: Potential in Sarcoma and Other Malignancies","publisher":"Molecular Cancer Therapeutics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWV4EABUyFGLpt2NNP6P1axcXwC80gbcCk,NAME_SEARCH,foOF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADbavAB_qgT8_0kYek0WRHBBD5jwr4J_ek,NAME_SEARCH,TIet)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABOvzsBsHNtBJON1g5_5lND9TpLVWGpHaY,NAME_SEARCH,XHw8)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUB2WgB5mB3ndq4nnC5RhHOAqqHkqFwCRI,NAME_SEARCH,eQAa)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"year":2008},"description":"Abstract\n\nClinical investigations of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase for the treatment of Pompe disease often reveal the appearance of therapy-specific antibodies.

Several immunosuppressive agents, including methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin A with azathioprine, were evaluated for their potential to induce immune tolerance to recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase. Methotrexate was the only agent that reduced recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase-specific antibody responses in acid alpha-glucosidase knock-out mice. A 3-week, low-dose methotrexate regimen controlled recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase-specific antibody levels throughout 8 months of weekly recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase treatment. The success of this methotrexate regimen appears to require methotrexate administration within the first 24 h of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase treatment. In an attempt to understand the benefit of methotrexate within the first day of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase administration, the immune response 24 h following intravenous recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase treatment was investigated.

A wide variety of treatment modalities were tested, including high dose tolerance induction, increased frequency of therapeutic doses and immunosuppressive drugs in combination with administration of enzyme. The most substantial effects were observed in mice injected intravenously with r-halphaGAL in combination with methotrexate (MTX), which significantly lowered r-halphaGAL-specific serum antibody levels. A short course of treatment with MTX was able to reduce antibody and spleen cell proliferative responses to long-term r-halphaGAL treatment. MTX was able to suppress the development of r-halphaGAL-specific IgG in antigen-primed mice. However, MTX was not effective in dampening robust ongoing antibody responses.

Sequencing of a 550-bp PCR product revealed that it encodes a protein homologous to the MSP-2 proteins of Anaplasma marginale. Concurrently, an expression library made from USG3 genomic DNA was screened with granulocytic Ehrlichia (GE)-positive immune sera. Analysis of two clones showed that they contain one partial and three full-length highly related genes, suggesting that they are part of a multigene family. Amino acid alignment showed conserved amino- and carboxy-terminal regions which flank a variable region. The conserved regions of these proteins are also homologous to the MSP-2 proteins of A. marginale; thus, they were designated GE MSP-2A (45 kDa), MSP-2B (34 kDa), and MSP-2C (38 kDa). The PCR fragment obtained as a result of peptide sequencing was completely contained within the msp-2A clone, and all of the sequenced peptides were found in the GE MSP-2 proteins. Recombinant MSP-2B protein and an MSP-2A fusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and reacted with human sera positive for the HGE agent by immunofluorescence assay.

These autologous cell lines were used to present human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral antigens in a processed and cell-associated manner to T lymphocytes. This was accomplished by either infecting the cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses or pulsing them with synthetic peptides and then subjecting them to a mild fixation step with glutaraldehyde. Fixed antigen-presenting cells were then used as stimulator cells in vitro to measure cell-mediated immune responses. Both the vaccinia virus-infected and peptide-pulsed autologous cells stimulated antigen-specific cellular proliferative responses. The magnitude of the responses correlated with the immunization histories of the animals and other measures of immunity, such as antibody titers. Autologous vaccinia virus-infected cells were also capable of inducing the in vitro maturation of CD4+ and CD8+ precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes into antigen-specific mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Unfortunately, they do not typically induce the types of cell-mediated immune responses required to control viral pathogens; specifically, they do not induce CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. To increase the immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, we have used the QS-21 saponin adjuvant in subunit vaccine formulations. In the current study, experimental subunit vaccine formulations containing recombinant p55gag or gp120env proteins from the mac251 strain of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) and the QS-21 adjuvant were used to immunize rhesus macaques. These formulations induced SIV gag- or env-specific cellular immunity that was detectable in vitro and included killer cell activity. The induction of killer cells required prior vaccination and the responses were antigen specific for the immunogens contained in the vaccine formulations. Autologous target cells were required to detect these responses, suggesting genetic restriction, and effector cells appeared to be present in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulations. These data suggest that the vaccine-induced killer cell activity that was detected was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Despite the presence of these killer cells, all of the animals became infected with the SIVmac251 on experimental challenge. These findings demonstrated that antigen-specific killer cell responses could be induced by a subunit vaccine formulated with the QS-21 saponin adjuvant.

O'Brien Ph.D. Thank you for your thoughtful response. At the age of six, I decided I wanted to be a scientist. Now approaching 63, I have never regretted that decision and admire the prescience of my six year old self. In the late 80's early 90's, I worked on HIV, including vaccine development. Clearly, we were unsuccessful, but the effort was still noble. During that time, I met Jonas Salk, truly a great honor. I had a part in drug development for patients with a rare disease, that kept babies alive. What could be more important than that? I was and still am a bench scientist with a four year undergraduate degree. It was easier to find your way into a reputable lab position then when not everyone was expected to have a PhD. Times have changed, and although I have trained well over a 100 people, I now tell young scientists,  that they must be able to accept failure and live by the words of a former boss, that we work for the patient. I also recommend that they consider regulatory affairs, program management or business development for a secure position.
