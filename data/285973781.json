The tumour cell density is related to the MRI-measured apparent diffusion-weighted coefficient (ADC). The purpose of the present study was to compare quantitative elastography based on ultrasound shear wave measurements with MRI ADC.\nMETHODS:\nWe prospectively examined 52 patients with histopathologically proven rectal cancer. The mean age was 67 years (range 42-90 years). Males: 39, females: 13. Tumour elasticity was measured transgluteally using the acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) to generate information on the mechanical properties of the tissue. The objective quantitative elastography shear wave velocity was blindly compared with the ADC measurements using a 1.5-T MRI system.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean tumour elasticity was 3.05\u2009m\u2009s(-1) [standard deviation (SD): 0.79], and the mean ADC was 0.69\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3)\u2009mm(2)\u2009s(-1) (SD: 0.27).

All patients had histologically confirmed colon cancer, a T4 or T3 tumour with extramural invasion \u2265 5 mm and no distant metastases or peritoneal nodules. The patients were treated with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. In addition, those with no mutations in the KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes were also treated with panitumumab. Before and after treatment, we measured the tumour diameter in two different planes, the extension of the extramural tumour invasion, and the number and size of enlarged lymph nodes.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean tumour length was 7.8 cm (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3-10.4) at baseline and 4.34 cm (95% CI: 4.0-4.9) after treatment.

Materials and Methods: Consecutive inclusion of 95 ERUS examinations and 110 elastography video loops with ERUS overlay mode. Video\u200aloops were randomized and evaluated by eight observers on two separate occasions. Observers were blinded to all clinical information except the circumferential location of the tumor. A continuous visual analog scale (VAS) and a categorical scale (W-score) were used for elastography evaluation. ERUS loops were T-staged according to the TNM classification system. Histopathological evaluation of surgical resection specimen was used as the reference standard. Results: Strain elastography visual evaluation yielded intraobserver variability from 0.86 to 0.97 and interobserver variability of 0.99.

The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of strain and shear-wave elastography for determining targets of varying stiffness in a phantom. The effect of target diameter on elastographic assessments and the effect of depth on shear-wave velocity were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We examined 20 targets of varying diameters (2.5-16.7 mm) and stiffnesses (8, 14, 45, and 80 kPa) with a 4-9-MHz linear-array transducer. Targets were evaluated 10 times with three different methods-shear-wave elastography, strain ratio, and strain histogram analysis-yielding 600 evaluations. AUCs were calculated for data divided between different stiffnesses. A 1.5-6-MHz curved-array transducer was used to assess the effect of depth (3.5 vs 6 cm) on shear-wave elastography in 80 scans. Mixed model analysis was performed to assess the effect of target diameter and depth. RESULTS. Strain ratio and strain histogram AUCs were higher than the shear-wave velocity AUC (p < 0.001) in data divided as 80 versus 45, 14, and 8 kPa. In data divided as 80 and 45 versus 14 and 8 kPa, the methods were equal (p = 0.959 and p = 1.000, respectively). Strain ratios were superior (p = 0.030), whereas strain histograms were not significantly better (p = 0.083) than shear-wave elastography in data divided as 80, 45, and 14 versus 8 kPa. Target diameter had an effect on all three methods (p = 0.001). Depth had an effect on shear-wave velocity (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION. The ability to discern different target stiffnesses varies between shear-wave and strain elastography. Target diameter affected all methods.

The purpose of the present study was to compare quantitative elastography based on ultrasound measurements in the course of chemoradiation with tumor response based on T stage classification and the Mandard tumor regression grading (TRG).\r\n\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined 31 patients with rectal cancer planned for high dose radiochemotherapy. The tumor and the mesorectal fat elasticity were measured using the Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse to generate information on the mechanical properties of the tissue.

The sub-classification was defined by the penetration of the rectal wall: a: 0 to 1 mm; b: 1-5 mm; c: 6-15; d: > 15 mm. Early tumors as ab (\u2264 5 mm) and advanced tumors as cd (> 5 mm). The TRUS findings were blinded to the radiologist performing the interpretation of the MRI images and measuring the depth of extramural tumor spread. RESULTS: TRUS found 51 patients to have an early \u2265 T3 tumors and 35 to have an advanced tumor, whereas MRI categorized 48 as early \u2265 T3 tumors and 38 as advanced tumors. The kappa value in classifying early versus advanced T3 rectal tumors was 0.93. We found a kappa value of 0.74 for the total sub-classification between the two methods. The mean maximal tumor outgrowth measured by TRUS, 5.5 mm  and on MRI, 6.3 mm, P = 0.004.

The odds ratio of having distant metastases in the ultrasound cd group compared to the ab group was 13.5, P = 0.00002. The mean maximal ultrasound measured outgrowth was 4.3 mm in patients without distant metastases, while the mean maximal outgrowth was 9.5 mm (95% CI: 6.2-12.8 mm) in the patients with metastases, P = 0.00004.

Patients with an elevated fCal should undergo colonoscopy including a persistent attempt to intubate the terminal ileum. CD isolated in the upper small bowel is rare, and in patients with a normal ileocolonoscopy or non-complicated CD in the colon and\/or terminal ileum, small bowel imaging provides little extra information compared to ileoscopy alone. Small bowel imaging is primarily indicated if ileoscopy is not achieved and capsule endoscopy is recommended as first line imaging technique.

CT-guided lung biopsies are now more frequently used than fluoroscopy-guided lung biopsies. The main aim of the present paper was to investigate the outcome and complications of the biopsies.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively collected the results and information from 520 CT-guided thorax biopsies. All biopsies were performed with CT-guided \"beam-through\" technique, using a 64-slice CT scanner.\n\nResults: In 86% of the biopsies, the tissue material was found to be sufficient. In 32% of the biopsies, a complication arose, mostly pneumothorax (30%), but chest drainage was needed in only 15% of the 520 cases. Patients with more than ten cigarette pack-years had a complication risk that was twice as high at that of patients with fewer pack-years. We found that the risk of pneumothorax increased the further the lesion was from the skin surface, the smaller the lesions were and when the patient was biopsied in a lateral position. We also found a higher risk of complications in females than in males.\n\nConclusions: CT-guided biopsy is an excellent tool for analysing pulmonary lesions. The present study clearly shows that the risk of developing a pneumothorax is significantly increased among smokers and former smokers with more than ten pack-years.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27264940\/","name":"Diagnostic yield and complications of transthoracic computed tomography-guided biopsies","publisher":"Dan Med J . 2016 Jun;63(6):A5239.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABELnRUBU2CcIHEimzql_-gkxT-4hLdwzm0,NAME_SEARCH,wTB1)"}]},{"name":"Testicular microlithiasis and testicular cancer: review of the literature","description":"Purpose: To perform a systematic literature review to assess whether the occurrence of testicular microlithiasis (TML) in conjunction with other risk factors is associated with testicular cancer.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search was performed of original articles in English published 1998 to 2015.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients examined with scrotal ultrasonography (US) in the period from 2008 through 2010 was performed. A total of 103 men with TML were diagnosed and offered US follow-up every 6 months for 2 years. They were retrospectively analyzed regarding demographics and follow-up details, including the development of any kind of malignancy until March 2015, using the Danish Electronic Pathology Registry. Results: The prevalence of TML was 10.3%. Of the 103 men with TML, 23 (22.3%) had TML in the left testicle, 38 (36.9%) in the right (p=0.002), and 42 (40.8%) had bilateral TML. Patient compliance was low with 11.7% participating in all US follow-up examinations. 5 men presented risk factors (testicular atrophy (N=1) and previous testicular cancer (N=4)), but no cases of testicular malignancy were found in the follow-up period. Conclusion: The low patient compliance conflicts with the ESUR Scrotal Imaging Subcommittee guidelines that recommend scrotal US follow-up annually for TML until the age of 55 years.

Materials and Methods: From January 2010 to December 2010, patients with CT-undetermined focal liver lesions were included in this study. A total of 78 patients were evaluated: 41 men and 37 women, mean age 61.8 years; age range 30-91 years. All patients were examined with GE LOGIQ 9E ultrasound scanners with contrast-specific software, and SonoVue intravenous bolus. The standard of reference was composite consisting of: percutaneous biopsy, surgical resection, PET\/CT and clinical follow-up. Results: The 78 included patients had 163 undetermined focal liver lesions, mean size 1.1 cm, range 0.1-5.3 cm. There were 18 malignant and 145 benign liver lesions, as defined by the standard of reference. In differentiating between benign vs. malignant CEUS demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 94.4% (95% CI: 56.3-99.5%), 99.3% (95% CI: 94.9 -99.9%), 94.4% (95% CI: 56.3-99.5%), 99.3% (95% CI: 94.9-99.9%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 94.9-99.7%), respectively. If the CEUS-inconclusive results were assumed to indicate malignancy, then sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy would be 95.8% (95% CI: 66.4-99.6%), 98.6% (95% CI: 94.4-99.7%), 92.0% (95CI: 65.1-98.6%), 99.3% (95% CI: 95.0-99.9%), 98.2% (95% CI: 94.4-99.5%). Conclusion: The results of this study showed a high diagnostic accuracy for CEUS in undetermined focal liver lesions found by CT.

Since the introduction of bowel-screening programs, the number of patients with advanced adenomas and early rectal cancer has increased. Despite improved diagnostics, the discrimination between rectal adenomas and early rectal cancer (i.e., pT1-T2) remains challenging. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) elastography in discriminating rectal adenomas from cancer.\n\nMethod: Using PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. Studies evaluating the primary staging of rectal adenomas and cancer using ERUS elastography were included.\n\nResults: Six studies were identified; three evaluated the discrimination between adenomas and cancer; two evaluated adenomas and early rectal cancer (i.e., pT1-T2); one evaluated performance on different T categories. All studies reported increased diagnostic accuracy of ERUS elastography compared to ERUS. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy ranged 0.93-1.00, 0.83-1.00 and 0.91-1.00, respectively, when discriminating adenomas from cancer. In the differentiation between adenomas and early rectal cancer, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.82-1.00, 0.86-1.00 and 0.84-1.00, respectively.\n\nConclusion: Elastography increases the accuracy of ERUS and may provide valuable information on malignant transformation of rectal lesions.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34439313\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABELnRUBU2CcIHEimzql_-gkxT-4hLdwzm0,NAME_SEARCH,wTB1)"}]},{"name":"The Impact of Patient Characteristics and Tumor Biology on the Accuracy of Preoperative Staging of Colon Cancer in Denmark.

Four radiologists with different levels of experience in MRI rectal cancer staging analyzed 36 MRI scans of 36 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. Inter- and intraobserver variation was calculated using interclass correlation coefficients and Cohens-kappa statistics, respectively. Inter- and intraobserver agreement for the length and width measurements was good to excellent, and for that of ADC it was fair to good. Interobserver agreement for the assessment of irregular border was moderate, heterogeneous signal was fair, round shape was fair to moderate, and extramesorectal lymph node location was moderate to almost perfect. Intraobserver agreement for the assessment of irregular border was fair to substantial, heterogeneous signal was fair to moderate, round shape was fair to moderate, and extramesorectal lymph node location was substantial to almost perfect.

Participants were 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, adequate organ function, and metastasis available for biopsy. Biopsies from the metastatic site were cultured using organoids model. Sensitivity testing was performed with a panel of drugs with proven activity in phase II or III trials. At the discretion of the investigator considering toxicity, the drug with the highest relative activity was offered. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive without disease progression at two months per local assessment.\nResults: Biopsies available from 82 to 90 patients were processed for cell culture, of which 44 successfully generated organoids with at least one treatment suggested.

Eligibility criteria were adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum, age 18-75 years and ECOG performance status 0-1. FOLFOXIRI was given in eight cycles followed by four cycles of 5-fluorouracil. \u03b4-tocotrienol 300 mg or placebo \u00d7 3 daily was added during chemotherapy and for a maximum of two years. The primary endpoint was time to hospitalization or death during treatment with chemotherapy.\nResults: Median time to first hospitalization or death was 3.7 months in the placebo group (95% CI 1.93-not reached (NR)), and was NR in the \u03b4-tocotrienol group (95% CI 1.87-NR) with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI 0.36-1.36). Grade 3-4 toxicities were uncommon in both groups, except for neutropenia, which occurred in 19 patients (58%) in the placebo group and 17 patients (50%) in the \u03b4-tocotrienol group. There were no grade 3 or 4 peripheral sensory neuropathy. In the placebo group, 24 patients (71%) had oxaliplatin dose reductions compared to 17 patients (47%) in the \u03b4-tocotrienol group (p = 0.047).\n\nConclusion: The addition of \u03b4-tocotrienol to FOLFOXIRI did not statistically significant prolong the time to first hospitalization or death compared to FOLFOXIRI plus placebo. Toxicity was manageable and not statistically different. There was a statistically significant difference in dose reductions of oxaliplatin pointing to a possible neuroprotective effect of \u03b4-tocotrienol.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/0284186X.2023.2249225","name":"Delta tocotrienol as a supplement to FOLFOXIRI in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

Key inclusion criteria; radical-intent treatment for mCRC and clinically eligible for triple-agent chemotherapy. Patients underwent a PET-CT scan before randomization. ctDNA analyses of plasma samples were done by ddPCR, detecting CRC-specific mutations and methylation of the NPY gene. In the ctDNA-guided arm, ctDNA positivity led to an escalation strategy with triple-agent chemotherapy, and conversely ctDNA negativity led to a de-escalation strategy by shared-decision making. Patients randomized to the standard arm were treated according to SOC. Feasibility measures for the run-in phase were; the inclusion of 30 patients over 12 months in two Danish hospitals, compliance with randomization >80%, rate of PET-CT-positive findings <20%, and eligibility for triple-agent chemotherapy >80%.\nResults: Thirty-two patients were included. The rate of PET-CT-positive cases was 22% (n = 7\/32). Ninety-seven percent of the patients were randomized. Fourteen patients were randomly assigned to SOC and sixteen to ctDNA-guided adjuvant treatment and follow-up. All analyses of baseline plasma samples in the ctDNA-guided arm passed the quality control, and 19% were ctDNA positive. The median time to result was three working days. All ctDNA-positive patients were eligible for triple-agent chemotherapy.\nConclusion: The study was proven to be feasible and continues in the planned large-scale phase II trial.

Using a 3.0 Tesla MRI machine, the main tumor mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC) was obtained. Surgically resected tumor specimens served as an endpoint, except in mucinous colon cancers, which were classified based on T2 images.\n\nResults: A total of 152 patients were included in the study population. The mean age was 71 years. A statistically significant mADC mean difference of -282 \u00d7 10-6 mm2\/s [-419--144 95% CI, p < 0.001] was found between colon adenomas and early colon cancer, with an AUC of 0.80 [0.68-0.93 95% CI] and an optimal cut off value of 1018 \u00d7 10-6 mm2\/s. Only a small statistically significant difference (p = 0.039) in mADC was found between benign tumors and mucinous colon cancer.

However, early diagnosis of malignant VCF is crucial to further treatment and prognosis. An earlier study at an orthopedic department reported a rate of unsuspected malignancy of 4.9% in patients with VCF who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) when biopsies were obtained during the procedure. MRI scanning protocol was changed in this period.\n\nMethods: Retrospective on 427 patients with vertebral compression fracture undergoing PVP from 28th of April 2017 to 28th of April 2022, identifying operated patients from the Danish national DaneSpine registry.
