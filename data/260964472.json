- 3 fatty acids are known as essential nutrients. Even though they\u2019re necessary for human health, they are not synthetized in human bodies, but rather taken in by alimentation. The source and quality of fatty acids in human diet is of great importance. The best natural source of omega - 3 fatty acids are fish and sea food. This research was conducted in Sarajevo in one of the shopping center chains to establish nutritive profiles of the food products that have been enriched with omega - 3 fatty acids with nutritious and healthy labels. The nutritive facts of the chosen food products were compared to nutritive profiles of the similar products without labels. Through this paper, we have referred to the general legislation and regulations governing the rules on the labeling, presentation and advertising of food products. Labeling can take different forms, such as words and pictorials that refer to a product. Each product contains omega - 3 fatty acids as highlighted on the nutrition claims, but it also contains omega-6 fatty acids as well as other harmful fatty acids, which is not mentioned on the label. A heart - shaped logo on these products is also considered a health claim, because it suggests positive effects on the cardiovascular system. The paper concludes whether the use of these products is justified by the stated claims and whether the consumers have a real health benefit by taking them in individual portions, without consuming large quantities of unnecessary fats or oils to achieve the recommended daily intake of omega - 3 fatty acids Key words: fatty acids, essential nutrients, omega \u2013 3 fatty acids, nutritious and healthy labels","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/337317749_Nutritive_profiles_of_the_food_products_high_in_omega_-3_acids_with_nutitious_and_healthy_labels_in_Sarajevo_market","name":"Nutritive profiles of the food products high in omega -3 acids with nutitious and healthy labels in Sarajevo market","publisher":"University of Sarajevo","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-OAHgBf4mDwCL_7zrrk5jFOyZxAT27TB8,NAME_SEARCH,2kHI)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC29Pr0BKzb5rhCsENDGRzRNfbs5zP8vt50, , )"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACFMHuABUJL-HIoMe0hG6Az7kLGPw57UY8E,NAME_SEARCH,H6Ep)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"year":2020},"description":"The plant Asphalatus linearis, better known as rooibos tea or \"mother's miracle from South Africa\", is present as an independent component of teas, and can also be found as an integral part of many tea blends present on the market of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a rich source of unusual glycosylated plant polyphenols, flavonoids, and also contains polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and a large number of minerals with various key health-promoting properties. Numerous studies have confirmed that Asphalatus linearis has positive effects on the gastrointestinal tract, has hepatoprotective, chemoprotective, and cardioprotective effects. It is also recommended for people with weak immunity, acute anemia due to iron deficiency and in the diet of breastfeeding mothers, and as an adjuvant in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus. The work is based on the hepatoprotective and hepatotoxic effects of Asphalatus linearis. In vitro studies have confirmed histological regressions of steatosis and cirrhosis in tissues, inhibition of increased malondialdehyde, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol, decreased plasma concentrations of aminotransferases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, which are considered markers of liver function, for which are responsible active components of the plant Asphalatus linearis. On the other hand, several case studies from clinical practice have shown exactly the opposite. In practice, it seems that Asphalatus linearis led to hepatotoxic effects, all under the inadequate use of this plant.

Phytotherapy is a method of treatment, prevention, and alleviation of symptoms with herbal drugs or all their parts such as root, leaf, flower, aboveground part of the plant, as well as preparations obtained by light processing of herbal parts. These are most often extracts, infusions, macerates, tinctures, and essential oils. De facto, the pharmacologically active ingredients of these plants are used in herbal treatment, and ultimately their standardized preparations. Herbal species used in the phytotherapy of hypertension are: Crategi folium cum flore, hawthorn leaf and flower; Alivi sativi bulbus, garlic bulb; Equiseti herba, horsetail. In addition to these species, the paper will mention new research in this field. The drugs that will be mentioned below are not newly discovered, but their hypotensive effect has been unknown so far.

Phytotherapy is often the first stage of treatment that patients turn to in self-medication. Herbal drugs intended for phytotherapy of hypertension are used daily in the diet but can be found as various dietary supplements both in pharmacies and in the free sale on the market, at points of sale that are not sufficiently legally regulated.

In this context, the summer boletus (Boletus edulis) proved to be very interesting. This fungus is a common fungus of the northern hemisphere, which is very widespread in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is an edible mushroom, and it has always been considered medicinal in this area. Summer boletus is considered a safe mushroom to pick because of its characteristic appearance and is very difficult to confuse with any other mushroom. However, care should be taken to collect it in places that are not exposed to heavy metals, as it is prone to their accumulation. It is a good source of protein, fat, B complex vitamins, fiber, copper, potassium, zinc, and selenium. A large number of studies have proven the antitumor activity of the extract of this fungus when it comes to colon cancer. Boletus edulis biopolymers extracted with hot water and purified by anion exchange chromatography showed antiproliferative activity in colon cancer cells. In this paper, a tabular presentation of studies that confirmed the potential of this fungus extract in chemoprevention is given. It is explained which parts of the genome are involved, how the mechanism of antitumor activity is realized. Finally, conclusions were drawn regarding the importance of this fungus in the daily diet, its antitumor potential, and the possibility of developing dietary supplements based solely on those parts of the genome Boletus edulis that showed antitumor activity, with the aim of preventing colon cancer.

It is used in almost all industries, and it has found its place even in the pharmaceutical industry (as an adjuvant), in the cosmetics and in the food industry in infant formulas. Despite the accepted idea that aluminum is harmless as an adjuvant, especially in vaccines, experimental studies show the opposite. Aluminum is precipitate in different tissues and causes delayed toxic effects. Different aluminum salts behave differently in the body. There are several well-established, routine methods for the qualification and quantification of aluminum in a biological sample, including accelerator fat spectroscopy (AMS), graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS), flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS), neutron activation analysis (NAA), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP - AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and microprobe laser mass spectrometry (LAMMA). This paper provides an overview of these methods. The most important method in the modern determination of aluminum is fluorescence microscopy, with lumogallion and morin as fluorophores. These methods have found their role in the determination of aluminum in brain tissue. Studies conducted from 2014 to 2020 are pioneering studies in this field that have successfully proven that there is indeed a cause-and-effect relationship between aluminum exposure and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In addition to long-established diseases associated with aluminum exposure such as kidney disease, bone disease, Crohn's disease, anemia, diabetes mellitus, breast cancer etc., new studies seek to use analytical methods to detect aluminum in a biological sample to prove its impact on infertility in both women and men.","publisher":"University of Sarajevo","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-OAHgBf4mDwCL_7zrrk5jFOyZxAT27TB8,NAME_SEARCH,2kHI)"}]},{"name":"Doping in sport","publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":1,"year":2021},"publisher":"EPSA Science!

The edible part of the plant is its fruit. It originates from tropical and subtropical America, and its existence was first recorded by Christopher Columbus. Today it is used worldwide in food and is widely distributed. In this paper, the focus is on the bromelain, a component isolated from the pineapple, which has been the subject of numerous research studies in recent years due to its antitumor effect. More specifically, an overview of studies related to the antitumor activity of bromelain is given. Bromelain, a cysteine protease extracted from the stem of pineapple, has a high binding affinity to the transcription factors p53 and \u03b2-catenin proteins that are key players in controlling the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. When it comes to colorectal cancer, in one study bromelain reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. In vivo, bromelain reduced the development of aberrant foci of colorectal cancer crypts and polyps. Bromelain has been shown to prevent nuclear factor \u03b1B (NF-\u03b1B) translocation through G2\/M arrest and contribute to cell death in human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Furthermore, bromelain slows the growth inhibition response of MCF-7 cells in breast cancer cells and stimulates the autophagy cycle while promoting monocyte cytotoxicity in women with breast cancer when administered orally. Bromelain has also shown in vivo antitumor activity in cell lines such as P-388 leukemia, sarcoma (S-37), Ehrlich ascetic tumor, Lewis lung carcinoma, and mammary adenocarcinoma ADC-755.
