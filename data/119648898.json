We previously showed that fission yeast pak1+ encodes an essential protein that affects mating and cell polarity. Here, we characterize a second pak gene (pak2+) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Cla4p and Skm1p, fission yeast Pak2p contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain in addition to a p21-binding domain and a protein kinase domain that are common to other members of the PAK family. Unlike pak1+, pak2(+) is not essential for vegetative growth or for mating in S. pombe. Overexpression of the wild-type pak2+ allele suppresses the lethal growth defect associated with deletion of pak1+, and this suppression requires both the pleckstrin homology- and the p21-binding domains of Pak2p, as well as kinase activity. A substantial fraction of Pak2p is associated with membranous components, an association mediated both by the pleckstrin homology- and by the p21-binding domains.

Antiviral treatments such as molnupiravir are used to mitigate severe COVID-19 outcomes, but the extended effects of these drugs on viral evolution in patients with chronic infections remain uncertain. This study investigates how molnupiravir affects SARS-CoV-2 evolution in immunocompromised patients with prolonged infections. The study included five immunocompromised patients treated with molnupiravir and four patients not treated with molnupiravir (two immunocompromised and two non-immunocompromised). We selected patients who had been infected by similar SARS-CoV-2 variants and with high-quality genomes across timepoints to allow comparison between groups.

The UShER pipeline and University of California Santa Cruz genome viewer provided insights into the global context of variants. Treated and untreated patients were compared, and mutation profiles were visualised to understand the impact of molnupiravir on viral evolution. Patients treated with molnupiravir showed a large increase in low-to-mid-frequency variants in as little as 10\u00a0days after treatment, whereas no such change was observed in untreated patients. Some of these variants became fixed in the viral population, including non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. The variants were distributed across the genome and included unique mutations not commonly found in global omicron genomes. Notably, G-to-A and C-to-T mutations dominated the mutational profile of treated patients, persisting up to 44 days post treatment.

Some of the most effective therapeutics for COVID-19 and, potentially, other coronavirus infections are antivirals that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). M pro inhibitors include nirmatrelvir, a component of the oral treatment Paxlovid. However, second-generation drugs are needed, because there is a risk that new SARS-CoV-2 variants could become resistant to nirmatrelvir and other antivirals in clinical use. Here, Westberg et al. used the hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor boceprevir as a starting point to make such a next-generation M pro inhibitor. Their optimized lead candidate, ML2006a4, exhibited robust antiviral activity in vitro and in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and could be administered orally. ML2006a4 appeared less sensitive to mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 M pro , suggesting that the virus would be less likely to become resistant to ML2006a4 in the real world. \u2014Courtney Malo Inhibitors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (M pro ) such as nirmatrelvir (NTV) and ensitrelvir (ETV) have proven effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but the presence of resistance-conferring mutations in sequenced viral genomes raises concerns about future drug resistance. Second-generation oral drugs that retain function against these mutants are thus urgently needed. We hypothesized that the covalent hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor boceprevir (BPV) could serve as the basis for orally bioavailable drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro more efficiently than existing drugs. Performing structure-guided modifications of BPV, we developed a picomolar-affinity inhibitor, ML2006a4, with antiviral activity, oral pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy similar or superior to those of NTV. A crucial feature of ML2006a4 is a derivatization of the ketoamide reactive group that improves cell permeability and oral bioavailability. Last, ML2006a4 was found to be less sensitive to several mutations that cause resistance to NTV or ETV and occur in the natural SARS-CoV-2 population. Thus, anticipatory design can preemptively address potential resistance mechanisms to expand future treatment options against coronavirus variants.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/scitranslmed.adi0979","title":"An orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor exhibits improved affinity and reduced sensitivity to mutations","sourceDomain":"science.org"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":14},{"type":"PRAISE","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7174914859967344640","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7174914859967344640","reactionsCount":16,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7174914859430547456","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gRKPJquP"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gRKPJquP"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7174914859430547456"}}},{"createdAt":1710603780000,"insightId":"eb53a5f9-7360-46b5-9c6f-a8cc0a294107","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQH9z9AJXV6bJQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1717217122011?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=hZX7_Oe0Vcsg2rRthr4XyhlUt6MU9JxuBbQ82icyu0c","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQH9z9AJXV6bJQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1717217122011?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=hZX7_Oe0Vcsg2rRthr4XyhlUt6MU9JxuBbQ82icyu0c"}]},"description":"Oral treatment with obeldesivir completely protects macaques from lethal infection with Sudan ebolavirus","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/full\/10.1126\/science.adk6176","title":"Oral administration of obeldesivir protects nonhuman primates against Sudan ebolavirus"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7174792332578316288","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7174792332578316288","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7174792332070834177","message":{"attributes":[],"text":""},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7174792332070834177"}}},{"createdAt":1709608320000,"insightId":"75d7dfb6-e182-4544-b6cd-915984e7c628","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQEQn3vWEMQSFg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712086744654?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=7XRnIUOJQfF7UxKqm6P6VuiVttgbMj4v2iwTgkd4kEc","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQEQn3vWEMQSFg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712086744654?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=7XRnIUOJQfF7UxKqm6P6VuiVttgbMj4v2iwTgkd4kEc"}]},"description":"Four years into the pandemic, many people have had COVID more than once\u2014but the health consequences of repeat infections are not yet clear","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/how-risky-are-repeat-covid-infections-what-we-know-so-far\/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=week-in-science&utm_content=link&utm_term=2024-02-16_top-stories","title":"How Risky Are Repeat COVID Infections?
