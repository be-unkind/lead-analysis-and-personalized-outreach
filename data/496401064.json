In this study, a natural ligand of FGFR, an engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1V), was conjugated to a potent cytotoxic drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and used as a targeting agent for cancer cells overexpressing FGFRs, similar to antibodies in antibody\u2013drug conjugates. The FGF1V\u2013valine\u2013citrulline\u2013MMAE conjugate showed a favorable stability profile, bound FGFRs on the cell surface specifically, and efficiently released the drug (MMAE) upon cleavage by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Importantly, the conjugate showed a prominent cytotoxic effect toward cell lines expressing FGFR. FGF1V\u2013vcMMAE was highly cytotoxic at concentrations even an order of magnitude lower than those found for free MMAE. This effect was FGFR-specific as cells lacking FGFR did not show any increased mortality.","url":"https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/DDDT.S105896","name":"Design and characteristics of cytotoxic fibroblast growth factor 1 conjugate for fibroblast growth factor receptor-targeted cancer therapy","publisher":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBTRyIBXZeUdY7ay2oHrXnaqPJomUW6LPw,NAME_SEARCH,vVPW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2WeqgBKXkEGaikW3_YTz_tV1AUlr1upn0,NAME_SEARCH,Si0-)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":8,"year":2015},"description":"Fibroblast Growth Factors Receptors (FGFRs) are overactive in many types of cancer and it is believed that their expression level correlates with a patient prognosis.

Here, we present a very efficient strategy for specific attachment of a cytotoxic drug to fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), a natural ligand of FGF receptors (FGFRs), which are overexpressed in several types of lung, breast and gastric cancers and are therefore an attractive molecular target. Recently we showed that FGF1 fused to monomethylauristatin E (vcMMAE) was highly cytotoxic to cells presenting FGFRs on their surface and could be used as a targeting agent alternative to an antibody. Unfortunately, conjugation via maleimide chemistry to endogenous FGF1 cysteines or a cysteine introduced at the N-terminus proceded with low yield led to nonhomogeneous products. To improve the conjugation, we introduced a novel Lys-Cys-Lys motif at either FGF1 termini which increased cysteine reactivity and allowed us to obtain FGF1 conjugate with a defined site of conjugation and a yield exceeding 95%. Using FGFR-expressing cancer lines we confirmed specific cytotoxity of the obtained C-terminal FGF1-vcMMAE conjugate and its selective endocytososis, as compared with FGFR1-negative cells. This simple and powerful approach relying on the introduction of a short sequence containing cysteine and positively-charged amino acids could be used universally to improve the efficiency of site-specific chemical modification of other proteins.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00158","name":"High-yield site-specific conjugation of fibroblast growth factor 1 with monomethylauristatin E via cysteine flanked by basic residues","publisher":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2WeqgBKXkEGaikW3_YTz_tV1AUlr1upn0,NAME_SEARCH,Si0-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBTRyIBXZeUdY7ay2oHrXnaqPJomUW6LPw,NAME_SEARCH,vVPW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABEHvF8BngRrgfntoxhPvWFTllqSK8YMMUU,NAME_SEARCH,47mD)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYa9VYBz2Wqknwe3ZRrJ97I_k8z-B-KFiE,NAME_SEARCH,mE_X)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"year":2017},"description":"Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of anticancer therapeutics that combine the selectivity of targeted treatment, ensured by monoclonal antibodies, with the potency of the cytotoxic agent. Here, we applied an analogous approach, but instead of an antibody, we used fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). FGF2 is a natural ligand of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), a cell-surface receptor reported to be overexpressed in several types of tumors. We developed and characterized FGF2 conjugates containing a defined number of molecules of highly cytotoxic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). These conjugates effectively targeted FGFR1-expressing cells, were internalized upon FGFR1-mediated endocytosis, and, in consequence, revealed high cytotoxicity, which was clearly related to the FGFR1 expression level. Among the conjugates tested, the most potent was that bearing three MMAE molecules, showing that the cytotoxicity of protein\u2013drug conjugates in vitro is directly dependent on drug loading.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsomega.7b00116","name":"Cytotoxic Conjugates of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) with Monomethyl Auristatin E for Effective Killing of Cells Expressing FGF Receptors","publisher":"ACS Omega","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2WeqgBKXkEGaikW3_YTz_tV1AUlr1upn0,NAME_SEARCH,Si0-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYa9VYBz2Wqknwe3ZRrJ97I_k8z-B-KFiE,NAME_SEARCH,mE_X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAW99q8BGraUDqyAkfITzkdLUok3d63Ufwc,NAME_SEARCH,39n5)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBTRyIBXZeUdY7ay2oHrXnaqPJomUW6LPw,NAME_SEARCH,vVPW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABbufx8B-zTG31jqD2UmJgben2RxqeVt-GU,NAME_SEARCH,VrA5)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715334900000,"insightId":"c2cfb2ba-00c5-4d57-af3f-f67ab8a0b85a","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194636123933999104","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194636123933999104","reactionsCount":3,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194636123464179713","message":{"attributes":[{"length":17,"start":332,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:marketingmanager"}}},{"length":11,"start":350,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:pharmajobs"}}},{"length":24,"start":362,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:pharmaceuticalmarketing"}}}],"text":"We're seeking a Marketing Manager with pharma industry experience to join the team to cover my maternity leave. \n\nThe team is truly the best you could ask to work with, and the role is always exciting, fast-moving and offers a lot of variety! \n\nIf you know anybody who might be interested, please share this opportunity with them.\n\n#MarketingManager #PharmaJobs #PharmaceuticalMarketing "},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQHRfXUVgQi4mA\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715333064710?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=lZzM729pTLAn6RUzwbZ6lnGp5ZAPVRw94Ewrr93Ir08"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194628339481931777","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1125,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eeSS-anz"}}},{"start":1150,"length":25,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:700448"}}},{"start":1176,"length":21,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:48725025"}}},{"start":1198,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:387934383"}}}],"text":"Vacancy: Marketing Manager (Maternity Cover)\n\nLocation: Cramlington, Northumberland (Hybrid - 1 day per week onsite)\n\nAs the Marketing Manager you will work as part of our global marketing team reporting directly to the Marketing Director where the main purpose of your role will be to deliver consistent, strategic and effective marketing across the globe.\n\nWe are looking for someone highly organised and creative with good analytical skills that is passionate about marketing and can work in a fast-paced environment.\u00a0We are a fast growing, dynamic business and this is a great opportunity to gain experience in an omni-channel, global marketing environment.\n\nWe are a fast-growing global pharmaceutical CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation), with more than 50 years\u2019 experience in developing and manufacturing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).\u00a0We are a proven and trusted partner to some of the world\u2019s most innovative biotechs and leading pharmaceutical companies and are widely recognised for our expertise in complex and hazardous chemistry.\n\nPlease click on the link to find out more....\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/eeSS-anz\nSterling Pharma Solutions\nEmma Greenwood (FCIM)\nEmily Brown ACIM"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194628339481931777"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194636123464179713"}}}]}
