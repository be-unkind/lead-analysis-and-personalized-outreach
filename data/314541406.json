However, few studies have investigated the specific subsites of the oropharynx. Following our previous research on tonsillar cancer, we assessed the increase in the incidence of base of tongue cancer and the prevalence of HPV in this disease. Between 1998 and 2007, 109 patients were diagnosed for base of tongue cancer in Stockholm county. Ninety-five paraffin-embedded diagnostic tumor biopsies from patients were obtained and tested for HPV, both by general HPV PCR and HPV-16\/HPV-33 type-specific PCR. Expression of HPV-16 RNA was analyzed to confirm E6 and\/or E7 expression. Incidence data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. An overall increase in the incidence of base of tongue cancer from 0.15\/100,000 person-years during 1970-1974 to 0.47\/100,000 person-years during 2005-2007 was found in Sweden. The prevalence of HPV in base of tongue cancer in Stockholm county increased from 58% during 1998-2001 to 84% during 2004-2007 (p < 0.05). In the HPV-positive tumors, HPV-16 dominated (86%) but interestingly, HPV33 was detected in as many as 10%. E6 and\/or E7 RNA were found in 85% of the samples tested.

A total of 615 women were analyzed for 24 different, mainly high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) types using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Luminex technology. A high HPV prevalence in this cohort was demonstrated, particularly with regard to HPV16, but also to all included HR-HPV types. Of the 544 successfully analyzed samples from non-vaccinated individuals, 70% were positive for the HPV types assayed for, and 62% were positive for HR-HPV types.

Microbes assist in the education of the developing immune system, maintain mucosal barrier integrity, and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through gut microbial fermentation. As such, recent studies have begun to deconvolve the composition and function of the microbiome in relation to cancer initiation and response to therapy. , , , The gut microbiome, which harbors the largest diversity of microbial species, is able to modulate responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and traditional chemotherapies , , , and have been implicated in instances of molecular mimicry with tumor neoantigens. Furthermore, early evidence has indicated that fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) may enhance clinical responses to ICB. , Microbial populations in primary tumors have been demonstrated to be distinct from those in non-malignant tissue, can reside intracellularly, , are capable of tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming and can be successfully presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II complexes. However, the biological and clinical relevance of the microbiome in metastases is still unclear. As metastases are responsible for the majority of solid cancer deaths and are key targets for systemic anti-cancer therapies, there is an urgent need to understand how tumor-resident bacteria can reshape tumor biology, immune infiltration, and responsiveness to treatment. Bacteria can induce both an immunosuppressed or inflamed microenvironment, and understanding these processes in tumors may help explain the heterogeneity of response to ICB. Yet, several questions still need to be addressed: is the microbial community in the primary tumor different from those in metastases? Are bacteria preferentially localized in specific tumor types or rather in specific organs? How resilient is the microbial population during therapeutic interventions? Given the complexity of identifying intracellular bacteria and the highly complex structure of the microbiome, we used a bioinformatics approach to investigate characteristics, evolution, and relevance of the metastatic cancer microbiome in patients. We analyzed biopsies from 4,160 metastatic tumors across various cancers originating from 26 tissues with matched genomics and transcriptomic profiling. Moreover, we assessed the persistence of the metastatic microbiome over time and under therapeutic pressure in a unique cohort of 185 paired biopsies of metastatic cancers.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell\/fulltext\/S0092-8674(24)00312-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286742400312X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue","title":"A pan-cancer analysis of the microbiome in metastatic cancer","sourceDomain":"cell.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":36}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183777981092286464","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183777981092286464","reactionsCount":36,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183777979552972800","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dCgx-FJG"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dCgx-FJG"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7183777979552972800"}}},{"createdAt":1715643720000,"insightId":"35a619c9-10fb-4356-8978-2c1355dabe2e","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7195275411801473025,7195931469268070400)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7195275411801473025","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Big congrats Dr. Wang!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7195275411801473025"}}},{"createdAt":1711563060000,"insightId":"977314e3-8b3a-4c17-b025-608c4c7cff68","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7178796012822544384,7178816013948379138)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7178796012822544384","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations \ud83c\udf7e"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7178796012822544384"}}}]}
