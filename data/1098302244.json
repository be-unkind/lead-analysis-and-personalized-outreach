Single-cell profiling of on- versus pre-treatment biopsies identified T cell expansion as an early response marker. In tumors, anti-PD-L1 triggered the expansion of mostly CD8+ T cells, whereas combination therapy expanded both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Such CD4+ T cells exhibited an activated T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-localized with and were surrounded by dendritic cells expressing T cell homing factors or antibody-producing plasma cells. T cell receptor tracing suggests that anti-CTLA4, but not anti-PD-L1, triggers the trafficking of CD4+ naive\/central-memory T cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs), via blood, to the tumor wherein T cells acquire a Th1 phenotype.\u201d\n\nNicely done!"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7176291790361161728"}}}]}
