Charge variant isoforms arise from modifications including deamidation, N-terminal pyroglutamate, sialylation, antibody fragmentation, and C-terminal lysine clipping. These acidic and basic charge variants can be critical quality attributes impacting function or safety of therapeutic antibodies. In the biopharmaceutical industry, imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF) is widely utilized for routine profiling of antibody charge variants. Although iCIEF remains a high-resolution technique for analyzing charge-based heterogeneity, the technique does not allow for identification of observed variants. Here we present successful reproduction of an iCIEF charge variant profile on a cation-exchange chromatography platform and utilize on-line mass spectrometry for assignment of antibody isoforms associated with each charge variant feature.\n","publisher":"ASMS 2019","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA5EgzEBezI0Vx2011OI7HoTEm2Sisvsq9o,NAME_SEARCH,Z_m3)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1713890460000,"insightId":"3d4c308b-0e7b-4c4e-8812-06c338deed23","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7188549540222750721,7188577689836888064)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7188549540222750721","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations, Anindya!
