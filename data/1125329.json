{"summary":"Enthusiastic about the medical device industry, because it is mission-driven, full of bright, motivated people of all backgrounds, and has no shortage of challenging scientific\/engineering problems. \n\nIncando Therapeutics is developing a novel form of implanted, repeatable light-activated therapy platform. One application of the platform is repeated photodynamic therapy (rePDT) as an adjuvant treatment for glioblastoma and other solid tumors. The combination therapy utilizes an implanted device in the body to locally activate a photosensitive drug, causing a chemical reaction which eradicates the tumor cells. Our preclinical evidence suggests a strong response, and we are launching our first clinical trial in 2023. Incando is a global company with presence in the USA, Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong.\n\nCheng has a background as a medical device design engineer, electronics system architect, and sensor engineer (optical, thermal, bio including SpO2, PPG, and ECG). He has a breadth of experience working in medical devices, consumer electronics, and semiconductors, both at tiny startups and at large companies including Maxim Integrated and Linear Technology. He is proud to have architected optical health sensor products that were used in over 100 million consumer devices worldwide. \n\nAt work, Cheng enjoys making products that to make the world a better place to live. He works best in small teams to get things done quickly and efficiently. Outside of work, he enjoys spending time with his two kids, running or cycling the roads and trails all around the San Francisco Bay Area, and enjoying great local wine and beer.","lastName":"Pei","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:1125329","geoRegion":"Belmont, California, United States","fullName":"Cheng-Wei Pei","firstName":"Cheng-Wei","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Incando Therapeutics","description":"As co-founder of a very small, early-stage, remote-only medtech\/biotech company with a global presence, I have the pleasure of working with very talented colleagues and friends on a brand-new kind of therapy to treat tumors of the brain.

As far as I can see from publicly-available data, the company did test this device in monkeys extensively.\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no substitute for testing in small groups of people, learning from any real-world issues that arise, and making adjustments to the device or its use (rinse, repeat as needed). \n\nReducing risk is the whole reason WHY clinical testing is important, and it should give everyone comfort that Neuralink was able to find issues prior to selling their product on the market. This is what differentiates the #medicaldevice industry from some other industries, where it's (too) easy and fast to release a product to the masses. \n\nSo my two cents is that we should leave Neuralink alone -- they are being fairly transparent, are working with the FDA as legally required, and the patient seems to be doing OK. By continuing their work, many patients could benefit in the future.

The 53-day odyssey will be the country\u2019s most complex and challenging Moon mission. If all goes according to plan, scientists will be examining the first rocks from the Moon\u2019s far side by late June. The 7.2-metre-tall, 8-tonne spacecraft lifted off aboard a Long March 5 rocket on Friday afternoon local time, piercing through a tropical rainstorm at the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on Hainan Island in China. Just over one hour into the flight, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced the launch \u201ca complete success\u201d, after the craft separated from the rocket and entered the designated Earth\u2013Moon transfer orbit. Quentin Parker, an astrophysicist at the University of Hong Kong, hails the launch as \u201cflawless\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s accomplishments in space exploration over the past few years are without precedent. If successful, this mission will be another science bonanza,\u201d he says. The lunar far side, which always faces away from us because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, could not be more different than its near side, says planetary scientist Bradley Jolliff at Washington University in St. Louis. Most of the ancient volcanic activity on the Moon happened on the near side, while the far side remained quieter under a thick and heavily cratered crust. \u201cYou would hardly know that they are from the same body by comparing the two sides,\u201d Jolliff says. A total of 10 missions, crewed or uncrewed, have brought back Moon rocks for analysis \u2014 all from the near side. Landing on the lunar far side requires, among other things, a communications satellite to relay signals between Chang\u2019e-6 and Earth. In March, China therefore launched the Queqiao-2 satellite, which is equipped with a 4.2-metre-diameter radio antenna \u2014 the largest type used in deep-space exploration. The satellite is now orbiting the Moon and waiting for Chang\u2019e-6 to arrive. After arriving at the Moon this week, the spacecraft will gradually decrease its orbit and prepare for landing in one of three pre-selected areas in the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin. The basin is the largest and oldest impact basin on the lunar surface, and samples from there will provide clues to the Moon\u2019s two-face mystery and the early history of the solar system. In early June, the spacecraft will drop a lander, which aims to drill and scoop up two kilograms of soil and rocks. After that, an ascender will blast off from the lander and ferry the samples back to the orbiter for the trip back home. Thanks to Queqiao-2, the spacecraft and Earth will remain in contact during the mission\u2019s crucial moments, such as the 15-minute descent and touchdown, the two-day sampling period and the 6-minute ascent. \u201cThe geological conditions on the far side are less clear. Whether we\u2019ll actually be able to scoop up or drill down, all remains to be seen when the sampling begins,\u201d Pei Zhaoyu, a senior CNSA official in Beijing and chief designer of China\u2019s upcoming Chang\u2019e-8 mission, told China Central Television during the launch livestream. Scientists hope Chang\u2019e-6 will also return material from beyond its landing site, such as rock fragments thrown over to the landing site from distant locations during powerful impacts, Jolliff says. The material collected at the landing site \u201cwill be like a treasure chest\u201d, he says. \u201cThe samples collected will be analysed for decades to come, and hopefully with access provided to the international research community,\u201d he says. Chang\u2019e-6 is expected to return to Earth around 25 June. If successful, the precious samples will land at the Siziwang Banner landing site in Inner Mongolia and be retrieved within 48 hours, according to the CNSA. doi: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/d41586-024-01345-5","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-024-01345-5","title":"China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 launched successfully \u2014 what happens next?","sourceDomain":"nature.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":4}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193678901766754304","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193678901766754304","reactionsCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193678901015945216","message":{"attributes":[{"start":307,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:science"}}},{"start":320,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:technology"}}},{"start":583,"length":6,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:china"}}},{"start":590,"length":6,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:space"}}},{"start":598,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gmGqvGWH"}}}],"text":"I grew up in an Asian household, hearing the tales about \u5ae6\u5a25 (romanized here as Chang'e).

Almost.\u00a0(Mosseri did not respond to a request for comment.) People have been called \u201cusers\u201d for a long time; it\u2019s a practical shorthand enforced by executives, founders, operators, engineers, and investors ad infinitum. Often, it is the right word to describe people who use software: a user is more than just a customer or a consumer. Sometimes a user isn\u2019t even a person; corporate bots are known to run accounts on Instagram and other social media platforms, for example. But \u201cusers\u201d is also unspecific enough to refer to just about everyone. It can accommodate almost any big idea or long-term vision. We use\u2014and are used by\u2014computers and platforms and companies. Though \u201cuser\u201d seems to describe a relationship that is deeply transactional, many of the technological relationships in which a person would be considered a user are actually quite personal. That being the case, is \u201cuser\u201d still relevant?\u00a0 The original use of \u201cuser\u201d can be traced back to the mainframe computer days of the 1950s. Since commercial computers were massive and exorbitantly expensive, often requiring a dedicated room and special equipment, they were operated by trained employees\u2014users\u2014who worked for the company that owned (or, more likely, leased) them. As computers became more common in universities during the \u201960s, \u201cusers\u201d started to include students or really anyone else who interacted with a computer system.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t really common for people to own personal computers until the mid-1970s. But when they did, the term \u201ccomputer owner\u201d never really took off. Whereas other 20th-century inventions, like cars, were things people owned from the start, the computer owner was simply a \u201cuser\u201d even though the devices were becoming increasingly embedded in the innermost corners of people\u2019s lives.
