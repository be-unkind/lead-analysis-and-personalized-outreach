Xenotransplantation is a potential solution to the shortage of organs for transplantation. However, potent xenograft rejection responses present a formidable barrier. Mixed xenogeneic hematopoietic chimerism has been shown in rat- to mouse models to induce tolerance among T, B, and NK cells. NK cells play an important role in the rejection of xenogeneic tissues. We have shown previously in an\nallogeneic mixed chimerism model that specific NK cell tolerance is induced. In a rat-to-mouse transplantation model, in contrast, it was observed that induction of mixed xenogeneic chimerism led to a global hyporesponsiveness of recipient NK cells. In this study, we investigated whether pig\/human mixed chimerism could tolerate human NK cells in a humanized mouse model. Our results showed that induction of human NK cells in pig\/human mixed chimeras did not lead to enhanced loss of pig chimerism. NK cells from most pig\/human mixed chimeric mice showed either specifically decreased cytotoxicity to pig cells or global hyporesponsiveness in in vitro cytotoxicity assay, indicating that mixed xenogeneic chimerism resulted in partial or complete tolerance of human NK cells to pig cells. Mixed\nxenogeneic chimerism did not hamper the maturation of human NK cells, but was associated with an alteration in NK cell subset distribution in the bone marrow.

However, major disadvantages that limit the utility of T cell therapy include MHC restriction of antigen presentation to T cell receptors (TCR), MHC downregulation as a mechanism of immune escape, and the lengthy time required to produce a sufficient number of tumor-specific T cells.  A major advance for adoptive T cell therapy that addressed these limitations is the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which is a single chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to the signal transduction domains of a TCR.  Antigen-specificity is encoded by the scFv, which is derived from the antigen-binding domains of an antibody.  Early in vitro studies demonstrated T cells could be re-targeted to an antigen by a CAR.  Later, we showed CAR-modified T cells kill tumor cells in mice.  The promise of CAR T cells was realized when we showed complete remission (CR) rates of nearly 90% in patients with relapsed\/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) infused with CD19-targeted CAR T cells (Davila et al., 2014).

We assessed the tolerance of human NK cells towards pig cells in a humanized mouse model with established pig and human mixed xenogeneic chimerism.\n\nWhile human NK cells were usually undetectable in peripheral blood prior to the injection of human Flt3L plasmid and IL-15\/IL-15 receptor alpha-Fc complex, they were detected by 5 days post-injection of IL-15 protein. 12 days post-induction of human NK cell reconstitution, pig cells remained detectable in peripheral blood, spleen, bone marrow and liver in the chimeric mice together with human NK cells. The co-existence of human NK cells and pig cells suggested that human NK cells in MCs might be tolerant to pig cells. Consistent with this notion, cytotoxicity assays showed that human NK cells from MCs demonstrated decreased killing of pig PBMC blasts compared to NK cells from Non-MC mice. Importantly, killing of K562 cells by NK cells from MCs mice was also decreased compared to that of Non-MC mice, suggesting that human NK cell tolerance to pig cells induced by mixed chimerism was associated with global hyporesponsiveness, as we have previously observed in a rat-to-mouse bone marrow transplantation model.

The prototypical second-generation CD19-targeted CAR features a costimulatory domain, either CD28 or 41BB, with both designs achieving comparable clinical outcomes against B-cell malignancies. However, clinical application of this technology has outpaced the understanding of its function in vivo. There is a need for extensive and rational side-by-side comparisons between CD28 and 41BB CARs in animal models. Therefore, we evaluated fully murine CD19-targeted CARs containing CD28 or 41BB in an immune competent B-ALL (B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) mouse model. In contrast to clinical results, a mouse 41BB CAR imparted inferior survival to a mouse CD28 CAR. This is secondary to defective signaling mediated by the mouse 41BB CAR. Replacement of the mouse 41BB intracellular domain with its human counterpart restored CAR signaling and yielded similar survival and persistence to the mouse CD28 CAR. Furthermore, targeted mutations of 5 amino acids on the mouse 41BB domain enhanced CAR signaling, NFKB activation, anti-apoptotic gene expression and cytokine production. Our study has long-term implications for improving CAR design and provides a platform for future studies of CAR T cell biology in animal models.","url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(16)30964-8\/abstract","name":"Mutation of the 41BB co-stimulatory domain enhances CAR signaling and mouse CD19-targeted CAR T cell function","publisher":"American Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) , Orlando, 2017","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASZQy8B4Lriav-GwwkRS59iGPGHT6uJWeM,NAME_SEARCH,EWTK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAX9UMkB2WCKc6KNqRoXxTuHsc7RKO17QsY,NAME_SEARCH,dd3v)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA1yOE0BInUYMC_iGQKYoi7C3UA1AKknT7c,NAME_SEARCH,xM9b)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":22,"year":2017},"description":"Current therapies for myeloid diseases have only modest success and the vast majority of patients will ultimately die.  Clearly, novel therapies are warranted and adoptive immunotherapies represent an exciting and promising cancer therapy.  The success of antibody-mediated therapy targeting immune checkpoint underscores the therapeutic potential of counteracting immune inhibition and T cell exhaustion. Other alternative immunotherapies consist of bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), which have had some success for leukemia. A major advance for adoptive T cell therapy is the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which is a single chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to the signal domains of a T cell receptor.  CAR-T cell therapy has significant potential as a cancer therapy because T cells can expand in numbers to eradicate large volume disease, traffic throughout the body, and provide patients with long-lived tumor immunity.  In particular, clinical success with CART19 has generated high complete response rates in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n\nCurrently, CAR T cells are being developed against CD33, CD123, CD44v6, as well as other antigens.  Early pre-clinical work suggests that CAR-T cell directed towards CD33 and CD123 are effective, but unfortunately also kill normal myeloid and\/or hematopoietic stem cells.  Considering the extensive B cell aplasia reported with CD19-targeted CAR T cells, a similar off-tumor, on-target toxicity for myeloid malignancies could result in bone marrow failure and\/or death.  Therefore, we have decided to compare the co-expression of various tumor markers on AML to identify candidates for multi-antigen targeting.  CAR-T cells with a combination of either of these markers would prove effective targeting against leukemic stem cells leaving normal stem cells unharmed.  We are also evaluating T cells from patients with myeloid malignancies to determine their suitability as an adoptive T cell therapy.","url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(16)30987-9\/abstract","name":"Immunotherapy target evaluation for myeloid diseases.","publisher":"American Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) , Orlando, 2017","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASZQy8B4Lriav-GwwkRS59iGPGHT6uJWeM,NAME_SEARCH,EWTK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAX9UMkB2WCKc6KNqRoXxTuHsc7RKO17QsY,NAME_SEARCH,dd3v)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABOxqWgBaUz3PoKWPNBpg4wsOuWWWGEcPYA,NAME_SEARCH,dYM8)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA1yOE0BInUYMC_iGQKYoi7C3UA1AKknT7c,NAME_SEARCH,xM9b)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":10,"year":2017},"description":"A recent study examining AML has shown that a TIM3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) blocks AML engraftment and eliminates leukemic stem cells (LSC).

Our own evaluation of TIM3 expression on AML blasts and LSC demonstrated that TIM3 is commonly co-expressed on CD33+ blasts. These results led us to hypothesize anti-TIM3 CAR T cells can target and kill AML, which we will evaluate by the development of novel anti-TIM3 CARs. Generation of new CARs rely on a time consuming and\/or costly process of phage display screening or hybridoma production, hybridoma screening, and immunoglobulin (Ig) sequencing. Here, we describe a novel CAR design strategy by next generation sequencing (NGS) followed by CAR synthesis and functionalvalidation against TIM3+ targets. NGS allows for direct identification of rearranged immunoglobulin genes, mutation and repertoire analysis, and comparison of multiple immunized mice. Furthermore, by eliminating the need for hybridoma production and screening we have developed a rapid, economical system for the development of novel CARs.","url":"http:\/\/www.bloodjournal.org\/content\/130\/Suppl_1\/2646?sso-checked=true","name":"Next Generation Sequencing of Immunized Mouse Splenocytes to Develop an Anti-TIM3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor for Acute Myeloid Leukemia","publisher":"ASH meeting Poster - Blood 2017 130:2646; ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASZQy8B4Lriav-GwwkRS59iGPGHT6uJWeM,NAME_SEARCH,EWTK)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":10,"year":2020},"description":"To find the best possible combination of CD33 and CD123 scFvs we double transduced T cells with four selected CD33 or CD123 scFvs each with only one co-stimulation domain either CD3z or 4-1BB in \u201cAND\u201d gate fashion.

Therefore, reduced-intensity (2\u20134 Gy) total body radiation (TBI) is currently used as a conditioning regimen resulting in mixed chimerism with the rescue of the SCD disease characteristic features. However, donor chimerism gradually reduces in a few years, resulting in a relapse of the SCD features, and organ toxicities remained the primary concern for long-term survivors. Targeted marrow irradiation (TMI) is a novel technique developed to deliver radiation to the desired target while sparing vital organs and is successfully used for HCT in refractory\/relapsed patients with leukemia.

Therefore, we examined preclinical feasibility to determine the tolerated dose escalation, its impact on donor engraftment, and reduction in organ damage using our recently developed TMI in the humanized homozygous Berkley SCD mouse model (SS). We show that dose-escalated TMI (8:2) (8 Gy to the bone marrow and 2 Gy to the rest of the body) is tolerated with reduced organ pathology compared with TBI (4:4)-treated mice. Furthermore, with increased SCD control (AA) mice (25 million) donor BM cells, TMI (8:2)-treated mice show successful long-term engraftment while engraftment failed in TBI (2:2)-treated mice. We further evaluated the benefit of dose-escalated TMI and donor cell engraftment in alleviating SCD features. The donor engraftment in SCD mice completely rescues SCD disease features including recovery in RBCs, hematocrit, platelets, and reduced reticulocytes.
