Although the Sonogashira reaction has traditionally been carried out in the presence of Pd catalyst and a co-catalyst of Cu(I) salt, the use of Cu(I) salt is often not efficient because it leads to the formation of unwanted side-products. This has prompted interest in recent years in the development of Cu-free Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction conditions. In addition, the development of Cu-free Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions for the alkynylation of nucleoside derivatives remains largely unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu- and amine-free Sonogashira-type cross-coupling lead to successful alkynylation of aryl bromides and heteroaryl bromides.

A library of 2-aminoimidazole-based small molecules combined with the antituberculosis drug isoniazid was screened against M. tuberculosis expressing in vitro drug tolerance as microbial communities attached to an extracellular matrix derived from lysed leukocytes. Based on the ability of nine of ten 2-aminoimidazole compounds to inhibit Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilm formation and three of ten molecules capable of dispersing established biofilms, two active candidates and one inactive control were tested against drug-tolerant M. tuberculosis. The two active compounds restored isoniazid susceptibility as well as reduced the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations of isoniazid in a dose-dependent manner.

Ectonucleotidases catalyze the sequential hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine, which potently suppresses T-cell and NK-cell functions via the adenosine receptors (A2a and A2b). The ectonucleotidase CD73 catalyzes the conversion of AMP to adenosine. Thus, increased CD73 enzymatic activity in the tumor microenvironment is a potential mechanism for tumor immune evasion and has been associated with poor prognosis in the clinic. CD73 inhibition is anticipated to restore immune function by skirting this major mechanism of adenosine generation. We have developed a series of potent and selective methylenephosphonic acid CD73 inhibitors via a structure-based design. Key binding interactions of the known inhibitor adenosine-5\u2032-(\u03b1,\u03b2-methylene)diphosphate (AMPCP) with hCD73 provided the foundation for our early designs.

Here, we report the systematic discovery of a novel class of non-nucleotide CD73 inhibitors that are more potent than all other nonphosphonate inhibitor classes reported to date. These efforts have culminated in the discovery of 4-({5-[4-fluoro-1-(2H-indazol-6-yl)-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazol-6-yl]-1H-pyrazol-1-yl}methyl)benzonitrile (73, IC50 = 12 nM) and 4-({5-[4-chloro-1-(2H-indazol-6-yl)-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazol-6-yl]-1H-pyrazol-1-yl}methyl)benzonitrile (74, IC50 = 19 nM). Cocrystallization of 74 with human CD73 demonstrates a competitive binding mode. These compounds show promise for the improvement of drug-like character via the attenuation of the acidity and low membrane permeability inherent to known nucleoside inhibitors of CD73.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.9b01713","name":"Discovery of Potent and Selective Non-Nucleotide Small Molecule Inhibitors of CD73","publisher":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAw7dloBybBGtL9PlpDYWzetg82oiC73-Qs,NAME_SEARCH,C5UY)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXk1hgBBslzbQA51HYXHI9PjNUlZ7Tyd-U,NAME_SEARCH,OhDa)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABqaCdcB39IDhONo0rzpTOAxWxvcCRWSQ9o,NAME_SEARCH,mWwn)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABDwNpcBVvWF4RCFOiDHWyf5UbnqBAJenV4,NAME_SEARCH,gdqb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABk5rV8B6lxcxNZa4s4vUEmT1GcfVdny5_I,NAME_SEARCH,6rjl)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB8bVYsBHgbbeQGhrYtIjp4RsmqSGdIN9Y4,NAME_SEARCH,mlz0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABpZsaABhGKNfnpyvD7nVAGKzRdFEJTA0EU,NAME_SEARCH,F4_A)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAhBLMcBJ8hm0-qHWHGZddggHntOTj3nfbg,NAME_SEARCH,BXBA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABa-GLwBp2Ogpi3LzNPHaltu_6NNYYr3j7k,NAME_SEARCH,wyqk)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEBy7wBncyqjOuUyeDxzN0pBtrIh9efSOI,NAME_SEARCH,utEo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABo6qDYBnulni9ksGFSxmz8uEd0VeW7i0EM,NAME_SEARCH,9NKM)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":1,"year":2017},"description":"A library of 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives was screened for the ability to suppress \u03b2-lactam resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Several non-bactericidal compounds were identified that reversed intrinsic resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in a manner distinct from \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Activity also translates to M.\u2005tuberculosis, with a lead compound from this study potently suppressing carbenicillin resistance in multiple M.\u2005tuberculosis strains (including multidrug-resistant strains).

However, ART has several potential limitations, including the development of drug resistance and suboptimal penetration to selected anatomic compartments. Improving the delivery of antiretroviral molecules could overcome several of the limitations of current ART. Results & Conclusion: Two to ten nanometer diameter inorganic gold crystals serve as a base scaffold to combine molecules with an array of properties in its surface. We show entry into different cell types, antiviral activity of an HIV integrase inhibitor conjugated in a gold nanoparticle and penetration into the brain in vivo without toxicity. Herein, gold nanoparticles prove to be a promising tool to use in HIV therapy.","url":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/fmc.15.57","name":"Gold nanoparticles to improve HIV drug delivery","publisher":"Future Medicinal Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAw7dloBybBGtL9PlpDYWzetg82oiC73-Qs,NAME_SEARCH,C5UY)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASaOfcBWwHb3ohWUzD1r71HL2EOiI4y6K8,NAME_SEARCH,vb8k)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABOByjUBjtLsBTCE9p5d9KdbUvFMbCkeUEc,NAME_SEARCH,BBMZ)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715382600000,"insightId":"75e71eb4-c593-4e2d-a39f-cf5c535865e9","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":11}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194836192251580416","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194836192251580416","reactionsCount":11,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194836192251580416","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Reposting for increased visibility.
