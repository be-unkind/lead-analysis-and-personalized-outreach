I tried being many different types of people, trying to find my place in this world, as a leader, a role model, a comrade, and a fighter; I felt like I didnt fit in. Now, I am all of those things while being unapologetically me, but it took me a while to get to where I am with confidence. I hope that the women who stand beside me, and my young three daughters, will live in a world where equality and inclusion are practiced, and women will fill roles that were kept out of reach.\n\nI am honored to be on this list with inspiring and brilliant women. I look forward to meeting everyone at the summit.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/ednYqvze\n\nThank you Worth Media Group and Burlington Bio.\n\n#groundbreaking-women-2024 "},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7184380828418744320"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7184399484741726208"}}}]}
