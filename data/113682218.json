The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have roles in guiding axons, but their signaling pathways are not completely understood. In this study, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study how the VAB-1 Eph RTK regulates the growth cone structure for axon guidance. Genetic and molecular data show that VAB-1 regulates the conserved molecules NCK-1, WSP-1\/N-WASP, and UNC-34\/Ena. Our study provides a model of how the VAB-1 Eph RTK modulates the growth cone structure to inhibit axonal outgrowth. We show that activated VAB-1 can inhibit an NCK-1\/UNC-34 interaction by binding to the NCK-1 SH2 domain. We also show that NCK-1 and WSP-1 can physically interact and that VAB-1\/NCK-1 and WSP-1 form a complex in vitro. We suggest that the VAB-1 Eph RTK can contribute to the termination of axon outgrowth by two methods: 1) The VAB-1\/NCK-1\/WSP-1 complex activates ARP-2\/3 to change the actin growth cone dynamics to that of a branched structure thus reducing the number of filopodia, and 2) VAB-1 inhibits axon extension by inhibiting UNC-34\/Ena's function in actin polymerization.\n\n","url":"http:\/\/www.plosgenetics.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002513","name":"The Caenorhabditis elegans Eph Receptor Activates NCK and N-WASP, and Inhibits Ena\/VASP to Regulate Growth Cone Dynamics during Axon Guidance","publisher":"PLOS Genetics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbGpyoBhU2o4r4r9of4RHye9wzgCQq-pnI,NAME_SEARCH,m-8i)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":2,"year":2013},"description":"Abstract \n\nInsulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling have fundamental roles in energy metabolism, growth and development. Recent research suggests hyperactive insulin receptor (IR) and hyperinsulinemia are cancer risk factors. However, the mechanisms that account for the link between the hyperactive insulin signaling and cancer risk are not well understood. Here we show that an insulin-like signaling inhibits the DAF-18\/(phosphatase and tensin homolog) PTEN tumour suppressor in Caenorhabditis elegans and that this regulation is conserved in human breast cancer cells. We show that inhibiting the IR increases PTEN protein levels, while increasing insulin signaling decreases PTEN protein levels. Our results show that the kinase region of IRb subunit physically binds to PTEN and phosphorylates on Y27 and Y174. Our genetic results also show that DAF-2\/IR negatively regulates DAF-18\/PTEN during C. elegans axon guidance. As PTEN is an important tumour suppressor, our results therefore suggest a possible mechanism for increased cancer risk observed in hyperinsulinemia and hyperactive IR individuals.\n\nOncogene advance online publication, 2 September 2013; doi:10.1038\/onc.2013.347","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/onc2013347a.html","name":"Insulin activates the insulin receptor to downregulate the PTEN tumour suppressor","publisher":"Oncogene","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbGpyoBhU2o4r4r9of4RHye9wzgCQq-pnI,NAME_SEARCH,m-8i)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"year":2015},"description":"A published abstract of the work I presented at the 2015 WorldSymposium.

Patients with ACDase deficiency manifest a spectrum of symptoms including formation of nodules, painful joints, and a hoarse voice. Classic FD patients will develop histiocytes in organs and die in childhood. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1; CCL2) is significantly elevated in both FD patients and a mouse model we previously generated. Here, to further study MCP-1 in FD, we created an ACDase;MCP-1 double mutant mouse. We show that deletion of MCP-1 reduced leukocytosis, delayed weight loss, and improved lifespan. Reduced inflammation and fibrosis were observed in livers from double mutant animals. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid analyses revealed a reduction in cellular infiltrates and protein accumulation. Furthermore, reduced sphingolipid accumulation was observed in the lung and liver but not in the brain. The neurological and hematopoietic defects observed in FD mice were maintained. A compensatory cytokine response was found in the double mutants, however, that may contribute to continued signs of inflammation and injury. Taken together, targeting a reduction of MCP-1 opens the door to a better understanding of the mechanistic consequences of ceramide accumulation and may even delay the progression of FD in some organ systems.","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-20052-6","name":"Deletion of MCP-1 Impedes Pathogenesis of Acid Ceramidase Deficiency","publisher":"Nature Publishing Company- Scientific Reports","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbGpyoBhU2o4r4r9of4RHye9wzgCQq-pnI,NAME_SEARCH,m-8i)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAhKF_sBdg8WXt_5Q3h49otFW0RNcST9KPo,NAME_SEARCH,9fRM)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":1,"year":2018},"description":"Farber disease (FD) is a debilitating lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by a deficiency of acid ceramidase (ACDase) activity due to mutations in the gene ASAH1. Patients with ACDase deficiency may develop a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Severe cases of FD are frequently associated with neurological involvement, failure to thrive, and respiratory complications. Mice homozygous (Asah1P361R\/P361R) for an orthologous patient mutation in Asah1 recapitulate human FD. In this study, we show significant impairment in lung function, including low compliance and increased\nairway resistance in a mouse model of ACDase deficiency. Impaired lung mechanics in Farber mice resulted in decreased blood oxygenation and increased red blood cell production. Inflammatory cells were recruited to both perivascular and peribronchial areas of the lung. We observed large vacuolated foamy histiocytes that were full of storage material. An increase in vascular permeability led to protein leakage, edema, and impacted surfactant homeostasis in the lungs of Asah1P361R\/P361R mice. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) extraction and analysis revealed accumulation of a highly turbid lipoprotein-like substance that was composed in part of surfactants, phospholipids, and ceramides. The phospholipid composition of BALF from Asah1P361R\/P361R mice was severely altered, with an\nincrease in both phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin. Ceramides were also found at significantly higher levels in both BALF and lung tissue from Asah1P361R\/P361R mice when compared\nwith levels from wild-type animals.

Both disorders are caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene that encodes the lysosomal hydrolase that breaks down the bioactive lipid ceramide. To date, there have been fewer than 200 reported cases of FD and SMA-PME in the literature. Typical textbook manifestations of classical FD include the formation of subcutaneous nodules, accumulation of joint contractures, and development of a hoarse voice. In reality, however, the clinical presentation is much broader. Patients may develop severe pathologies leading to death in infancy or may develop attenuated forms of the disorder wherein they are often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed until adulthood. A clinical variability also exists for SMA-PME, in which patients develop progressive muscle weakness and seizures. Currently, there is no known cure for FD or for SMA-PME. The main treatment is symptom management. In rare cases, treatment may include surgery or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Research using disease models has provided insights into the pathology as well as the role of ACDase in the development of these conditions. Recent studies have highlighted possible biomarkers for an effective diagnosis of ACDase deficiency. Ongoing work is being conducted to evaluate the use of recombinant human ACDase (rhACDase) for the treatment of FD. Finally, gene therapy strategies for the treatment of ACDase deficiency are actively being pursued. This review highlights the broad clinical definition and outlines key studies that have improved our understanding of inherited ACDase deficiency-related conditions.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13023-018-0845-z","name":"Acid ceramidase deficiency: Farber disease and SMA-PME","publisher":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbGpyoBhU2o4r4r9of4RHye9wzgCQq-pnI,NAME_SEARCH,m-8i)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1712204520000,"insightId":"4e5ee8b7-b7fb-4f0c-8b66-0751811b3cb3","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:job:3880685243"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":18}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7181506514648530944","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7181506514648530944","reactionsCount":18,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7181506514111619073","message":{"attributes":[{"start":40,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gPZM3Mwp"}}}],"text":"A great new role for an amazing team!!! https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gPZM3Mwp "},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7181506514111619073"}}},{"createdAt":1709931000000,"insightId":"616df1c1-21e3-4c2b-80b2-b8385b559270","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:job:3847874346"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":28}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7171970568689184769","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7171970568689184769","reactionsCount":28,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7171970568110501889","message":{"attributes":[{"start":76,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gH4_T-hp"}}}],"text":"Great opportunity to join a great team.
