For example, some viruses use genetic recombination to insert their entire genetic code into a host organism\u2019s cell, effectively hijacking it. The cell turns into a virus factory that makes thousands of new viruses from the new genetic material.\n \nGenetic recombination has also proven to be a powerful tool for genome editing and genetic engineering practices by taking advantage of site-specific recombinases \u2013 enzymes that facilitate recombination, but only at very specific places in the genome.\n \nThere are only a sparse number of site-specific recombinases that have been well characterised. To remedy this, SMORE is being developed as a complete toolkit of recombinases that have been thoroughly characterised. The team hopes that these parts will contribute to ongoing projects like Brainbow, a method that uses recombinases to make neurons express distinct colors of fluorescent protein, allowing individual neurons to be distinguished from one another when studying the brain.","title":"iGEM 2017","url":"http:\/\/2017.igem.org\/Team:Edinburgh_UG","members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB0rcXcBn6CmT_N8AJuMKoptb2JyF06ehrM,NAME_SEARCH,-l3V)"}],"startedOn":{"month":2,"year":2017}}],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Pharmaceutical Manufacturing","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2020},"degree":"Master of Science -
