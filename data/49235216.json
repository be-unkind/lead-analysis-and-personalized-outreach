B cell responses are critical for the protective immunity induced by the vaccine, yet their epitope targets recognized in humans remain largely unclear. The present proposal will systematically map B cell epitopes in a set of 12 vaccinia virus antigens of specific immunological relevance. We will apply three complementary epitope mapping techniques - linear peptide mapping, X-ray crystallography, and viral mutagenesis - to reduce biases introduced by any one technique. The identified epitopes will be validated by testing their recognition in sera from vaccinated humans, and their protective capacity in a murine challenge model. We will further study the mechanisms of antibody mediated protection, assessing the impact of antibody isotype on protection in vivo and the importance of complement for neutralization of infectivity in vitro. We will examine if antibody functional abilities can be predicted based on their biochemical ability to bind virions and infected target cells. Finally, the identified epitopes will be used to develop and test a novel algorithmic tool that predicts the epitope recognized by a given antibody. All epitopes and newly developed algorithms will be made publicly available in the IEDB. In summary, our proposal will help fill the gaps in knowledge of targets and mechanisms of protective antibody responses induced by this classic vaccine, and also develop predictive tools that can be applied to any pathogen of interest and accelerate epitope identification. This will further increase the value of vaccinia virus as a model for future effective vaccine design.","title":"VACV high throughput screening, determination of vaccinia virus B-cell

Here we describe the biochemical and structural characterization of one of the immunodominant vaccinia virus (VACV) antigens, D8, and its binding to the monoclonal antibody LA5, which is capable of neutralizing VACV in the presence of complement. The full-length D8 ectodomain was found to form a tetramer. We determined the crystal structure of the LA5 Fab-monomeric D8 complex at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, as well as the unliganded structures of D8 and LA5-Fab at resolutions of 1.42 \u00c5 and 1.6 \u00c5, respectively. D8 features a carbonic anhydrase (CAH) fold that has evolved to bind to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chondroitin sulfate (CS) on host cells. The central positively charged crevice of D8 was predicted to be the CS binding site by automated docking experiments. Furthermore, sequence alignment of various poxvirus D8 orthologs revealed that this crevice is structurally conserved. The D8 epitope is formed by 23 discontinuous residues that are spread across 80% of the D8 protein sequence. Interestingly, LA5 binds with a high-affinity lock-and-key mechanism above this crevice with an unusually large antibody-antigen interface, burying 2,434 \u00c52 of protein surface.

Unlike DCs, LP SCs constitutively expressed the enzymatic machinery to produce RA even in the absence of dietary vitamin A, but were not able to do so in germ-free mice implying regulation by microbiota. Interestingly, DCs promoted GM-CSF production by the SCs indicating a two-way cross-talk between both cell types.

To study the role of antibodies in preventing D8 adhesion to CS-E, we have used a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies, and tested their ability to compete with CS-E for D8 binding. Among four antibody specificity groups, MAbs of one group (group IV) fully abrogated CS-E binding, while MAbs of a second group (group III) displayed widely varying levels of CS-E blocking.

Why this is the case and how the smallpox vaccine overcomes this challenge remain incompletely understood. We previously showed that high concentrations of anti-B5 antibodies are insufficient to directly neutralize EV (M. R. Benhnia, et al., J. Virol. 83:1201\u20131215, 2009). This allowed for at least two possible interpretations: covering the EV surface is insufficient for neutralization, or there are insufficient copies of B5 to allow anti-B5 IgG to cover the whole surface of EV and another viral receptor protein remains active. We endeavored to test these possibilities, focusing on the antibody responses elicited by immunization against smallpox. We tested whether human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the three major EV antigens, B5, A33, and A56, could individually or together neutralize EV. While anti-B5 or anti-A33 (but not anti-A56) MAbs of appropriate isotypes were capable of neutralizing EV in the presence of complement, a mixture of anti-B5, anti-A33, and anti-A56 MAbs was incapable of directly neutralizing EV, even at high concentrations. This remained true when neutralizing the IHD-J strain, which lacks a functional version of the fourth and final known EV surface protein, A34. These immunological data are consistent with the possibility that viral proteins may not be the active component of the EV surface for target cell binding and infectivity. We conclude that the protection afforded by the smallpox vaccine anti-EV response is predominantly mediated not by direct neutralization but by isotype-dependent effector functions, such as complement recruitment for antibodies targeting B5 and A33.","url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/87\/3\/1569.short","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALvRRABqTyrcOJgUPFqu3swPsLpOgCv57M,NAME_SEARCH,yf_D)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":8,"year":2014},"description":"Antibody epitope mapping is crucial for understanding B cell-mediated immunity and required for characterizing therapeutic antibodies.

The predictions are based on residue-pairing preferences and other interface characteristics. We combined these antibody-specific predictions with results of cross-blocking experiments that identify groups of antibodies with overlapping epitopes to improve the predictions. We validate the high performance of this approach by mapping the epitopes of a set of antibodies against the previously uncharacterized D8 antigen, using complementary techniques to reduce method-specific biases (X-ray crystallography, peptide ELISA, deuterium exchange, and site-directed mutagenesis). These results suggest that antibody-specific computational predictions and simple cross-blocking experiments allow for accurate prediction of residues in conformational B cell epitopes.","url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/structure\/abstract\/S0969-2126(14)00043-4?cc=y#","name":"Using a Combined Computational-Experimental Approach to Predict Antibody-Specific B Cell Epitopes","publisher":"Structure \/ CellPress","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALvRRABqTyrcOJgUPFqu3swPsLpOgCv57M,NAME_SEARCH,yf_D)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":12,"year":2014},"description":"Vaccinia virus (VACV) L1 is an important target for viral neutralization and has been included in multicomponent DNA or protein vaccines against orthopoxviruses. To further understand the protective mechanism of the anti-L1 antibodies, we generated five murine anti-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which clustered into 3 distinct epitope groups. While two groups of anti-L1 failed to neutralize, one group of 3 MAbs potently neutralized VACV in an isotype- and complement-independent manner. This is in contrast to neutralizing antibodies against major VACV envelope proteins, such as H3, D8, or A27, which failed to completely neutralize VACV unless the antibodies are of complement-fixing isotypes and complement is present. Compared to nonneutralizing anti-L1 MAbs, the neutralization antibodies bound to the recombinant L1 protein with a significantly higher affinity and also could bind to virions. By using a variety of techniques, including the isolation of neutralization escape mutants, hydrogen\/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography, the epitope of the neutralizing antibodies was mapped to a conformational epitope with Asp35 as the key residue. This epitope is similar to the epitope of 7D11, a previously described potent VACV neutralizing antibody. The epitope was recognized mainly by CDR1 and CDR2 of the heavy chain, which are highly conserved among antibodies recognizing the epitope. These antibodies, however, had divergent light-chain and heavy-chain CDR3 sequences.

Only group I antibodies neutralized MV in a complement-dependent manner and protected against VACV challenge, while a group II mAb protected partially but did not neutralize.
