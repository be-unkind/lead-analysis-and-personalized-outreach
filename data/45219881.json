you know if you are a leader, manager, or a mix?\n\nLean into the Leadership vs. Management Challenge\n\n\nYour team aims to reach the peak of success.\nYou want to get there together.\n\nThink of it this way, as Stephen Covey said:\nA manager helps the team climb fast.\nA leader checks if the ladder's against the right wall.\n\nLeadership and management mix but are not the same.\nKnowing how they differ helps you get better at both.\n\n\nThis infographic was put together by Eric Partaker.\n\n______\n\nLeadership is about the people.\n\u2022 Guiding & coaching.\n\u2022 Forging relations at work.\n\u2022 Getting everyone excited.\n\u2022 Dreaming up a future and innovation.\n\nManagement is about the process.\n\u2022 Getting stuff done well and fast.\n\u2022 Ensuring things run smooth.\n\u2022 Making plans.\n\n______\n\nA leader can be good at managing.\nA manager can be a great leader.\nTeams need both to win big. \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\n\nWant to be better at both? Here\u2019s how:\n\nTo be a better leader:\n1. Really listen.\n----> Hear what your team wants and thinks.\n2. Share your dream.\n----> Make it something they want, too.\n3. Say \"good job.\"\n----> Everyone likes a pat on the back.\n4. Let them shine.\n----> Give them important jobs.\n\nTo boost your management game:\n1. Be clear about goals.\n----> Everyone should know their job.\n2. Stay organized.\n----> Make plans and line up your ducks.\n3. Talk about their work.\n----> Feedback helps everyone do better.\n4. Watch how it\u2019s going.\n----> See how things move and tweak if needed.\n\n\nMix these skills to lead and manage like a pro.\nMake a place where your team loves to work and grow.\n\nTogether, you'll climb higher than ever. \ud83c\udfc6 \n\n\nRepost to share this. \u267b\ufe0f\nFollow Ronnie H.
