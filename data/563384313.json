Hardware components used for this design included Infrared sensor, load cell, microphone, Arduino microcontroller, and XBee Wireless modules.  EagleCAD, and MATLAB were the two main programs used in developing this project. The circuit design was done and then transferred onto EagleCAD to complete the PCB design of the circuit. MATLAB was used for wireless communication, and the GUI interface. The goal of this project was to help protect the wildlife population. This design can also be used for other applications such as baby monitoring system, and a home healthcare monitoring system.
