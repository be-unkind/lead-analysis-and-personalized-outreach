relationship between the two concepts in the context of agri-food SME of the Languedoc-Roussillon region in France. Intangible assets and particularly brands play a very important role in strategies success. The importance of intangible assets is now well recognized by both companies as researchers despite the complexity of their evaluation. Thus, building strong brands is one of the most important objectives of a company to maximize turnover and profit. Due to the economic crisis, and a lack of finance capacity, many SMEs have been forced to open their capital to new shareholders who provide capital but also change in steering companies. Based on agency and stewardship theories, we analyze theoretically whether the adoption or changing of branding strategies is guided by particular modes of governance or market imperatives and marketing strategies. We find that corporate governance influences branding strategies in SMEs through the role of the manager, the ownership structure and the SMEs size.","url":"http:\/\/prodinra.inra.fr\/?locale=fr#!ConsultNotice:338461","name":"Corporate governance of SMEs and branding strategies","publisher":"EIASM, 29-30 Octobre 2015","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAnfLHIBgwrHZfv3lQW7T8OmjAQVkWgUHZI,NAME_SEARCH,Nqf6)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":15,"year":2013},"description":"The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of the governance structure on branding strategies. The link between ownership structure and strategy is supported by the literature, in particular in Math\u00e9 and Rivet 1993 or Le Vigoureux in 1997. Methodologically, studies show that corporate governance is contingent on the creation of value (Remaud, H., 2011), innovation (Couderc and Stephany, 2005; Ambiaud, 2009; Chouaibi, J. and al, 2010) and mediumsized enterprises strategies (Le Vigoureux, F 1997) It remains important to properly characterize the nature of the relationship between agri-food SME\u2019s1 and the strategies used to present their products on the market. The question therefore arises from several perspectives: Do managers expect a change in brand policy when new participants invest in the SME\u2019s capital? Are they aware of this? Are they sensitive? The Leaders themselves, are they still making their own decisions? Are they aware that brand policy changes can be generated following an entry in their capital? At the opposite, does a change in governance have any effects on market strategies? At first, however, and precisely for this communication, we choose a quantitative approach to measure the phenomenon. We simply seek to measure the impact of a change in the governance strategies. The database allows us to identify companies that have followed different perspectives: Starting with small farms that were bought out, those associated.... These forms allow us to observe the time changes made after the structural change. Agree to submit its products under the brand or under their own brand, share an umbrella brand, benefit and support the quality of its products, a collective brand reflects involving strategic decisions. Finally, it is apparent that changes in branding were a clear marker indicating the impact that a change in governance could operate.","url":"http:\/\/prodinra.inra.fr\/?locale=fr#!ConsultNotice:192684","name":"Governance of SMEs and branding strategies : the case of agri-food SMEs \u00bb","publisher":"Augustin Cournot Doctoral Days (ACDD)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAnfLHIBgwrHZfv3lQW7T8OmjAQVkWgUHZI,NAME_SEARCH,Nqf6)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2015},"description":"The brand is the most important asset for enterprises. In a competitive marketplace, brand is considered the best way to differentiate products, to build corporate image and to develop bargaining power with retailers. Branding strategies are therefore a key aspect of corporate decision making. In this paper, the authors analyse the relationship between the ownership structure of agri-food SMEs and branding strategies. A conceptual model of how these variables are related is proposed and empirically tested using data from two surveys (2003 and 2010) of a representative sample of agri-food SMEs in the Languedoc\u2013Roussillon region (South of France). The results show that ownership structure influences branding strategies in SMEs. This finding might be considered a challenge to the relevance of applying agency theory to a very particular form of enterprise and sector of activity.
