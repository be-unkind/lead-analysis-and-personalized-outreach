{"summary":"It has been my privilege to work in the healthcare industry for the last 30 years specializing in Behavioral Healthcare and Substance Use Disorders (SUD). My experiences in diverse healthcare settings has culminated in a high level of skill in direct care, nursing leadership, program development and operations. I offer these skills in my current chapter as an Executive Leader for B. E. Smith\/AMN. Utilizing my vast array of skills as an interim executive leader\/consultant, I can help any organization to stabilize, grow and bridge the gaps as they navigate through periods of transition or reorganization. Whether your need is for a Director of Nursing, CNO, Program Director or Director of Operations, I am confident my skills and experience can be of value to any organization looking to establish excellence in their clinical or operational areas of performance.","lastName":"Fitzgerald","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:220747377","geoRegion":"Greater Tampa Bay Area","fullName":"Michael Fitzgerald","firstName":"Michael","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Joie de Vivre World LLC","title":"Partner","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":6,"numMonths":5},"startedOn":{"month":1,"year":2018}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA0oVnEB-j817F4StoC_RquLLRxZUz6f9yA,NAME_SEARCH,n0Gc)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1657853986479?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=lk29ZimqPLPvT-MizAfyJmzQSzOmDGJKgFwXCr388OA","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1657853986479?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=_WTzKyIZnJP5Xx6s7s5hAjJzpYG47IedUEcP_QtKFs0","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1657853986479?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=use1Wu4ckDnuF8p_uSVZNmGYRe8MHIZmPT_mTRDdpNQ","height":400},{"width":602,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1657853986479?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=UFBXTabC1-AHSslMarLKcxFl7McBpfVF3vW0raCcb9A","height":602}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C5603AQF5xwd9GBQrAQ\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[],"contactInfo":{"websites":[{"$anti_abuse_annotations":[{"attributeId":97,"entityId":19,"sourceUrn":"urn:li:member:220747377"},{"attributeId":48,"entityId":19,"sourceUrn":"urn:li:member:220747377"}],"category":"PERSONAL","dataSource":"LINKEDIN","url":"www.besmith.com"}]},"industry":"Mental Health Care","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":1997},"degree":"Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.)","eduId":137234855,"fieldsOfStudy":["Registered Nursing\/Registered Nurse"],"schoolName":"University of Maine","startedOn":{"year":1991}},{"endedOn":{"year":1997},"degree":"Associate of Science (A.S.)","eduId":233510660,"fieldsOfStudy":["Human Services, General"],"schoolName":"University of Maine","startedOn":{"year":1991}}],"skills":[{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Interpersonal Skills"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Policies & Procedures"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"De-escalation"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Delegation"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Hospital Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Performance Improvement"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Training and Development (HR)"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Marketing"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Business Relationship Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":3,"name":"Acute Care"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Quality Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Communication"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Team Building"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Leadership"},{"numOfEndorsement":2,"name":"Team Leadership"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Analytical Skills"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Social Services"},{"numOfEndorsement":3,"name":"Post Traumatic Stress"},{"numOfEndorsement":6,"name":"Group Therapy"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Trauma Informed Culture"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Risk Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Labor Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Regulatory Compliance"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Operations Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Employee Engagement"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Transformational Leadership"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Revenue Cycle Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Patient Experience"},{"numOfEndorsement":5,"name":"Depression Treatment"},{"numOfEndorsement":30,"name":"Behavioral Health"},{"numOfEndorsement":26,"name":"Mental Health"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Chemical Dependency"},{"numOfEndorsement":9,"name":"Program Development"},{"numOfEndorsement":4,"name":"Psychiatry"},{"numOfEndorsement":24,"name":"Healthcare"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Staff Development"},{"numOfEndorsement":5,"name":"Customer Service"},{"numOfEndorsement":11,"name":"Public Speaking"},{"numOfEndorsement":29,"name":"Hospitals"},{"numOfEndorsement":13,"name":"Healthcare Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":10,"name":"Nursing"},{"numOfEndorsement":5,"name":"Inpatient"},{"numOfEndorsement":6,"name":"Crisis Intervention"},{"numOfEndorsement":4,"name":"Clinical Supervision"},{"numOfEndorsement":4,"name":"Training"},{"numOfEndorsement":6,"name":"Treatment"},{"numOfEndorsement":4,"name":"Physician Relations"},{"numOfEndorsement":6,"name":"Strategic Planning"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Addiction Recovery"}],"numOfConnections":1062,"patents":[],"headline":"Interim Executive Director B.
