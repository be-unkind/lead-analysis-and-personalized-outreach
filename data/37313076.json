This is especially true for research in the biomedical sciences.  Innovations in biotechnology and engineering have led to instruments encompassing attributes of robotics, parallelization and miniaturization, with seamless connection through the cloud.  They are ubiquitously deployed at the bench and the bedside, generating massive amounts of data over unprecedented scales of space and time, and enabling the \u201cOmics Revolution,\u201d capturing information that spans the genome, transcriptome, proteome and beyond.  This convergence of biology and technology was best captured by Steve Jobs, who said \u201cI think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning.\u201d  In an article published in Cell, Eric Topol mapped out this convergence between biology and technology in terms of a resource akin to Google Map for the human body \u2013 superimposing layers of data captured (including environmental exposure data) when we \u2018measure and quantify\u2019 humans in their normal and diseased states.  The resulting immense data sets, generated from Omics-based platforms such as next generation sequencing, biosensors such as wearable devices, and patient data from electronic health records (EHR), is denoted as Big Data.  It has been a tremendous boon for biomedicine, and is already guiding precision medicine in clinical practice, as well as facilitating the search for transformational, safe and effective therapies in drug discovery.","publisher":"BioBuzz feature article, BIO2017","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAI5WjQBMsnRKGlCm-WtrlMTW2Om-EM2Pm8,NAME_SEARCH,yICd)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMnEWsBnU8lYCOSwP_Iy-9mBwAq_SJrbTA,NAME_SEARCH,uB_p)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714406760000,"insightId":"34aac620-1575-4438-b443-be7f2b3d0563","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQGHwrom5UAAKQ\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1714406767134?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=dGl7ovWH2dABQu1c4B9EOOOXOhPStzZ8SKggOQOcSqI"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":25},{"type":"PRAISE","count":14},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7190743164742238208","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7190743164742238208","reactionsCount":41,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7190743163844669440","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:97185175"}}},{"start":268,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eTzdEaEM"}}},{"start":294,"length":17,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:14593114"}}},{"start":312,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:genetherapy"}}},{"start":325,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:celltherapy"}}},{"start":338,"length":4,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:rna"}}},{"start":343,"length":32,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:cellandgenetherapymanufacturing"}}},{"start":376,"length":17,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:biomanufacturing"}}},{"start":394,"length":3,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ai"}}},{"start":398,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:aiforgood"}}},{"start":409,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:innovation"}}},{"start":421,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:wewillcure"}}},{"start":433,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:phorum2024"}}},{"start":445,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:demopit"}}},{"start":454,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:innovation"}}},{"start":466,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:techtrends"}}}],"text":"BioCurie is excited to announce that we\u2019ll be presenting at @philapact\u2019s Phorum 2024!

Those business leaders shared their experiences dealing with gaps in the supply chain, including how it impacted their manufacturing capabilities and workforce. Tim Langlois is with the product development and manufacturing company Advanced Materials Technology (AMT). \u201cSo we're a small manufacturer of HPLC columns, and that doesn't mean much to most people but what that's used for is critically important to manufacture pharmaceuticals, and run diagnostics for people,\u201d he explained. Langlois notes losing access to the stainless steel tubes they need due to supply chain issues can greatly affect pharmaceutical manufacturing. \u201cI think one of the things that we recognized, and I think the pandemic highlighted it, is that we haven\u2019t had a real whole of government focused on our supply chains. We also need to mark and monitor what those shocks and disruptions are to be able to predict for the future,\u201d said Blunt Rochester. Blunt Rochester hopes to address tracking supply chain disruptions in her new legislation, the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act . That would create a program that expands mapping and monitoring, seeks ways to address shocks to the supply chain before they happen, and increases engagement with the key allies. Blunt Rochester and Harris also highlighted the Department of Commerce\u2019s new Supply Chain Center, which also works to proactively aid the U.S. supply chain. \u201cWe're looking to leverage our industry expertise and our analytical insights to be able to have a more proactive and strategic approach in understanding what supply chains need to be strengthened and what steps can be targeted to do so. Our idea is that this is key to jobs, it's key to economic growth, and it's key to national security,\u201d said Harris. Blunt Rochester\u2019s Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act (H.R. 6571) passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in December.

Rombel, who cofounded BioCurie with MIT professor Richard Braatz in 2021, was the only woman CEO representing a winning startup on the stage. In the world of biotech startups, it wasn\u2019t a surprise.\u00a0 \u201cI was the only one!\u201d Rombel told Technical.ly. \u201cBut it\u2019s not unusual.\u201d\u00a0 Based on her company\u2019s name, it\u2019s probably not surprising that Rombel looked up to the physicist and chemist Marie Curie during her childhood. Growing up in a working-class home with Polish immigrant parents, Rombel saw the Polish-born Curie as a role model. Rombel studied biochemistry, eventually earning a Ph.D. at the University of Otago in New Zealand. She\u2019s been an assistant professor, an investor, a consultant and a senior director of strategic analysis at Johnson & Johnson. \u201c[At Johnson & Johnson] I saw these life-saving therapies that are really going to transform human life, cure diseases that currently have no treatments,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cBut then I realized, these are really, really hard to develop and to produce and, sure enough, they cost a lot of money for the patient, which is not tenable.\u201d\u00a0 It was the same at Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics , where she went on to work as chief of staff for research. Around that time, Rombel first met Braatz at a NIIMBL (The National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals) conference where he was speaking. \u201cI\u2019d read his research because he developed some of the first AI models for gene therapy production and is a world leader in artificial intelligence for biomanufacturing,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cAnd he had the same vision that I had.\u201d Braatz and Rombel decided to join forces and cofound BioCurie to revolutionize cell and gene therapy manufacturing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s just going to be incremental,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cWe want to have something that\u2019s really going to impact the industry and our most important patients.\u201d BioCurie\u2019s proprietary AI-driven technology is called the mAI-BioCurie platform. Instead of empirical experiments in a lab, the software produces a digital twin on which it runs millions of experiments to find solutions faster and ensure consistency in manufacturing. Ultimately, it should reduce the cost of developing therapies, making them more affordable for patients. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re developing the first AI-driven software platform to help biopharmaceutical companies and manufacturers figure out the optimal recipe,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cIt sounds simple, but it\u2019s so hard.\u201d As winners of the Cure Exchange Challenge, BioCurie has access to seed funding and is now part of a one-year residency at Cure\u2019s New York City campus incubator. \u201cWe hope to have raised our pre-seed and possibly even our seed round in a year,\u201d Rombel said.\u00a0 If all goes to plan, BioCurie will forge strategic partnerships and launch its first product by the end of the residency.\u00a0 Rombel plans to stay in Delaware, where, among other things, she mentors students at Delaware Technical and Community College. The commute to Cure\u2019s campus is less than two hours by train. \u201cThe company is physically based in Wilmington, and Richard is up [in Boston] at MIT,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cSo now we\u2019ll have a presence in New York, Greater Philly and right in the heart of Philadelphia.\u201d With the US Economic Development Administration\u2019s selection of The Greater Philadelphia Region Precision Medicine Tech Hub last fall, BioCurie, which very much fits the definition of precision medicine, is right where it needs to be, Rombel said.\u00a0 \u201cThis is such a great region,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first gene therapy came out of CHOP [Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia], the first cell therapy came out of UPenn, the first mRNA vaccine came out of Penn. And then there are all these spinouts , and now there\u2019s us.\u201d Irene Rombel will give a virtual talk, \u201c Pioneering BioCurie\u2019s Vision ,\u201d on LinkedIn Live on March 12 and 12:30 pm, as part of Cure\u2019s Tuesday Talks series.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/technical.ly\/startups\/ai-cell-gene-therapy-biocurie-wilmington-irene-rombel\/","title":"AI-driven gene therapy coming from Delaware\u2019s BioCurie","sourceDomain":"technical.ly"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7171627471853744129","message":{"attributes":[{"start":5,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:97185175"}}},{"start":28,"length":5,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:66936140"}}},{"start":65,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:37313076"}}},{"start":175,"length":19,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:166660"}}},{"start":319,"length":17,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1207"}}},{"start":545,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gttChZju"}}},{"start":571,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:genetherapy"}}},{"start":584,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:celltherapy"}}},{"start":597,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:biopharma"}}},{"start":608,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:delaware"}}}],"text":"When BioCurie won the first Cure.

A version of it\u00a0 originally appeared \u00a0in the podcast's newsletter. It appears here as part of a media partnership between Technical.ly and Founding Philly. Artificial intelligence is transforming the life sciences sector with its capabilities and promise, said two Philadelphia-area startup founders with platforms built around AI. Irene Rombel of BioCurie and Nyron Burke of Lithero joined Founding Philly\u2019s live podcast recording at Venture Cafe to share their insights on the fast-evolving technology and its future effects on biotech and pharma. \u201cAfter a therapy is developed, commercializing it can cost up to twice the amount spent on R&D. Imagine reducing that by 60% through AI,\u201d said Burke, who serves as Lithero\u2019s CEO. Founded in 2015, the company was using AI before it was seemingly everywhere, developing software to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pharmaceutical marketing.\u00a0 Its flagship product, the Lithero Artificial Review Assistant (LARA), aims to automate the compliance review of marketing materials, ensuring they meet stringent industry standards while saving valuable time and resources. The goal: ensuring the public receives accurate content and understands the risks and benefits. BioCurie\u2019s AI-driven platform, meanwhile, aims to optimize manufacturing conditions, eliminating costly trial-and-error methods.\u00a0 Established in Wilmington in 2021 with a vision to make life-saving therapies more accessible, the company\u2019s inception stemmed from Rombel\u2019s background in biochemistry and her experiences at Johnson & Johnson and local genetics powerhouse Spark Therapeutics , where she recognized the prohibitive costs and complexities of developing life-saving therapies.\u00a0 These challenges inspired her to partner with Richard Braatz, a professor at MIT known for his pioneering AI models in biomanufacturing. Together, they aimed to create substantial industry impact rather than minor improvements. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s just going to be incremental,\u201d Rombel said. BioCurie quickly gained recognition, including a win at the Cure Xchange Challenge (where Rombel was the only female CEO on stage) that garnered the startup a coveted spot in a New York City incubator program. At the Venture Cafe podcast session, both CEOs also shared their personal journeys in the tech industry, and delved into the broader implications of AI in the life sciences, from enhancing drug development to ensuring compliance and facilitating faster commercialization.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/technical.ly\/startups\/ai-medicine-biocurie-lithero-founding-philly\/","title":"From lab to market: Two Philly biotech founders on AI\u2019s potential to revolutionize medicine","sourceDomain":"technical.ly"}}}},{"createdAt":1709826420000,"insightId":"9cc57e4d-ca53-439f-916b-e36cc3e7f079","activityUnion":{"mitnActivity":{"article":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQHXosLfV5wbsg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1716971692824?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=zZcpOAQ_bv4L7RzASIkUW2C_JmXRcXODvz9Q898_RfY","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQHXosLfV5wbsg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1716971692824?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=zZcpOAQ_bv4L7RzASIkUW2C_JmXRcXODvz9Q898_RfY"}]},"publishedAt":1709815756000,"description":"When the Wilmington biopharma company won the first Cure Xchange Challenge, its founder was the only woman CEO on stage.","fullText":"When Wilmington-based biotech company BioCurie became one of seven AI-based healthcare startups to win the inau gural Cure Xchange Challenge in New York City, Dr. Irene Rombel couldn\u2019t help noticing something.

Rombel studied biochemistry, eventually earning a Ph.D. at the University of Otago in New Zealand. She\u2019s been an assistant professor, an investor, a consultant and a senior director of strategic analysis at Johnson & Johnson. \u201c[At Johnson & Johnson] I saw these life-saving therapies that are really going to transform human life, cure diseases that currently have no treatments,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cBut then I realized, these are really, really hard to develop and to produce and, sure enough, they cost a lot of money for the patient, which is not tenable.\u201d\u00a0 It was the same at Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics , where she went on to work as chief of staff for research. Around that time, Rombel first met Braatz at a NIIMBL (The National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals) conference where he was speaking. \u201cI\u2019d read his research because he developed some of the first AI models for gene therapy production and is a world leader in artificial intelligence for biomanufacturing,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cAnd he had the same vision that I had.\u201d Braatz and Rombel decided to join forces and cofound BioCurie to revolutionize cell and gene therapy manufacturing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s just going to be incremental,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cWe want to have something that\u2019s really going to impact the industry and our most important patients.\u201d BioCurie\u2019s proprietary AI-driven technology is called the mAI-BioCurie platform. Instead of empirical experiments in a lab, the software produces a digital twin on which it runs millions of experiments to find solutions faster and ensure consistency in manufacturing. Ultimately, it should reduce the cost of developing therapies, making them more affordable for patients. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re developing the first AI-driven software platform to help biopharmaceutical companies and manufacturers figure out the optimal recipe,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cIt sounds simple, but it\u2019s so hard.\u201d As winners of the Cure Exchange Challenge, BioCurie has access to seed funding and is now part of a one-year residency at Cure\u2019s New York City campus incubator. \u201cWe hope to have raised our pre-seed and possibly even our seed round in a year,\u201d Rombel said.\u00a0 If all goes to plan, BioCurie will forge strategic partnerships and launch its first product by the end of the residency.\u00a0 Rombel plans to stay in Delaware, where, among other things, she mentors students at Delaware Technical and Community College. The commute to Cure\u2019s campus is less than two hours by train. \u201cThe company is physically based in Wilmington, and Richard is up [in Boston] at MIT,\u201d Rombel said. \u201cSo now we\u2019ll have a presence in New York, Greater Philly and right in the heart of Philadelphia.\u201d With the US Economic Development Administration\u2019s selection of The Greater Philadelphia Region Precision Medicine Tech Hub last fall, BioCurie, which very much fits the definition of precision medicine, is right where it needs to be, Rombel said.\u00a0 \u201cThis is such a great region,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first gene therapy came out of CHOP [Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia], the first cell therapy came out of UPenn, the first mRNA vaccine came out of Penn. And then there are all these spinouts , and now there\u2019s us.\u201d Irene Rombel will give a virtual talk, \u201c Pioneering BioCurie\u2019s Vision ,\u201d on LinkedIn Live on March 12 and 12:30 pm, as part of Cure\u2019s Tuesday Talks series.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/technical.ly\/startups\/ai-cell-gene-therapy-biocurie-wilmington-irene-rombel\/","title":"AI-driven gene therapy coming from Delaware\u2019s BioCurie","sourceDomain":"technical.ly"}}}},{"createdAt":1709818080000,"insightId":"45f8cf67-6fea-4c0f-b68d-e6ef0e00b8a9","activityUnion":{"mitnActivity":{"article":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQHvr6NMorRHoQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711038408682?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=JUbIduK30z3FzmU54JxC4YhIT91tguyO-dedADvFM9E","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQHvr6NMorRHoQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711038408682?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=JUbIduK30z3FzmU54JxC4YhIT91tguyO-dedADvFM9E"}]},"description":"BioCurie is one of five companies selected for the one-year program by NYC\u2019s Cure, which is focused on using AI to improve healthcare.","fullText":"BioCurie, a Wilmington biotech startup that develops AI-based software for cell and gene therapy, is joining the inaugural Cure Xchange Challenge: Health AI for Good . The one-year incubation residency with Cure, a New York City healthcare innovation campus, includes unrestricted seed money from a $1 million funding pool, mentors and access to in-kind resources from partners like NVIDIA and Amazon Web Services. BioCurie was one of 10 finalists selected in January, after a round of interviews where the Delaware startup pitched its mechanistic AI technology \u2014 known as mAI \u2014 for cell and gene therapy [CGT] manufacturing. \u201cOur solution will enable biopharma companies and contract manufacturers to drive down the time, cost, and risk of CGT production, while improving product quality, safety, and commercial viability,\u201d BioCurie CEO, president, and cofounder Irene Rombel said in the Cure Xchange Challenge Solutions Overview . Rombel said the tech will allow developers and manufacturers \u201cto accurately predict the best production conditions for their cell, gene, and nucleic acid therapy products.\u201d In addition to BioCurie, four other AI healthcare startups were selected for the program. They are: The cohort will use AI to address some of the biggest challenges in healthcare, including inequitable care, inefficiencies and high healthcare costs. At the same time, they\u2019ll address ethical concerns with AI, from public trust to fairness to privacy, according to Cure CEO Seema Kumar. \u201cAI-driven tools have the potential to be a game changer in improving human health and solving health inequities that persist in underserved communities,\u201d Kumar said in a statement. \u201cThis innovative group of Challenge winners are pioneering the future of healthcare, where AI responsibly empowers us to create and deliver equitable, accessible and transformative care for all.\u201d Check out this video to get a glimpse of the Cure Campus and learn more about the program.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/technical.ly\/startups\/wilmington-ai-biotech-startup-biocurie-cure-incubator\/","title":"Wilmington AI biotech startup wins NYC incubator spot","sourceDomain":"technical.ly"}}}},{"createdAt":1715634780000,"insightId":"935cccf1-d4d7-468b-9b63-3004fb2e3062","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":4},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1},{"type":"ENTERTAINMENT","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7195868979553337346,7195893877059342337)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7195868979553337346","reactionsCount":6,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Outstanding!
