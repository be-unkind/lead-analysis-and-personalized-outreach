This is in addition to the 9 acres of pollinator habitat planted at the site in 2016.\n\nThe new prairie is located at the site of the Elk River Energy Recovery Station, a waste-to-energy power plant that was closed in 2019.\n\n\u201cIt only made sense that we would help the bees expand their habitat in Elk River,\u201d said Andrew Stewart, director of business operations at Great River Energy. \u201cThe native pollinator habitat at Elk River is a great example of Great River Energy\u2019s commitment to sustainability. This habitat captures carbon, reduces runoff and snow drifts, and supports species of birds and insects that are critical for the pollination of many agricultural crops. It does all this while saving our members money and reducing the use of pesticides, water and fer\u00ad\u00adtilizer. It is a win for the environment, the community and for our member-owner cooperatives.\u201d\n\nGreat River Energy continues to add more acres to its pollinator-friendly portfolio. To date, there are more than 200 acres of native habitat planted at its various locations.","url":"https:\/\/greatriverenergy.com\/pollinator-habitats-grow-in-elk-river\/","name":"Pollinator habitat grows in Elk River","publisher":"Great River News","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANL98QBR9iZHwkQWYw_X-A9v30iy7eFLz0,NAME_SEARCH,-76w)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":20,"year":2021},"description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major changes to the way Great River Energy conducts its business. What has not changed is the importance of engaging member-owners in the cooperative\u2019s projects. Great River Energy has found new ways to gather stakeholder input while keeping the public safe and healthy.\n\nGreat River Energy recently held a virtual open house for its Winthrop transmission project. Public open houses for transmission projects allow the public and interested parties to provide input for the proposed route, state any concerns and ask questions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to us that our communities feel informed about the projects in their areas,\u201d said Vice President and Chief Transmission Officer Priti Patel. \u201cWe proactively reach out to property owners, local leaders and the community as a whole on these important and needed projects.\u201d\n\nGreat River Energy is working with member-owner McLeod Cooperative Power Association (McLeod) on the Winthrop project which consists of rebuilding an existing 9.25-mile, 69-kilovolt transmission line in McLeod and Sibley counties. The rebuild is necessary to improve the reliability of the transmission system in the area, and reduce risks associated with low voltage and transmission line overloading. The line was originally constructed in 1946 and has reached its end of life.\n\n\u201cWe wanted landowners to be informed about the project and have an opportunity to ask questions and share their feedback,\u201d said Michelle Lommel, senior field representative at Great River Energy. \u201cWe typically host these open houses in community centers or township halls as an open forum. With the pandemic, we made the decision to go virtual.\u201d\n\nPanelists from Great River Energy\u2019s permitting, engineering and project management departments, along with a McLeod employee, participated in a question and answer session after the formal presentation.\n\nThe Winthrop project is anticipated to be in service in the spring of 2024.","url":"https:\/\/greatriverenergy.com\/transmission-project-kicks-off-during-virtual-open-house\/","name":"Transmission project kicks off during virtual open house","publisher":"Great River News","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANL98QBR9iZHwkQWYw_X-A9v30iy7eFLz0,NAME_SEARCH,-76w)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":15,"year":2021},"description":"Whenever you flip a switch, plug in your phone or open your refrigerator, you\u2019re relying on the grid to bring you reliable electricity.\n\nAt the most basic level, the electric grid is a set of interconnected wires connecting places where energy is produced to where it is used. Over time, the grid has become smarter, more dynamic, and increasingly interconnected due to advancements in technology along with additional wind and solar energy resources.\n\nGreat River Energy uses the grid to move energy as well as information to ensure reliable electric service and quick response times when there is an issue on the electric system.\n\nBut how does the grid work?\n\nElectricity from power plants and wind farms travels along high voltage transmission lines to the places where it can be \u201cstepped down\u201d and used. Specialized transformers reduce the electric energy down to a lower voltage making it suitable for high-volume delivery over short distances.\n\nPower lines belonging to Great River Energy\u2019s 28 member-owner cooperatives carry electricity to smaller transformers that reduce power to levels appropriate for use at schools, farms, small businesses and homes.\n\nFor homeowners and businesses that have installed solar panels, wind turbines or other generators, the grid is always there to supply energy when the sun isn\u2019t shining or the wind isn\u2019t blowing.\n\nGreat River Energy works with its member-owner cooperatives to ensure a resilient grid able to meet growing demand and address the complexities of integrating renewable resources.","url":"https:\/\/greatriverenergy.com\/wherever-energy-is-needed-the-grid-is-there\/","name":"Wherever energy is needed, the grid is there","publisher":"Great River News","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANL98QBR9iZHwkQWYw_X-A9v30iy7eFLz0,NAME_SEARCH,-76w)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715632140000,"insightId":"846e2a82-1bb3-4970-ad14-f3568d23d7e1","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:multiPhoto:1000167546724"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":14},{"type":"PRAISE","count":6},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7195882911038935041","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7195882911038935041","reactionsCount":21,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7195882911038935041","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1543,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:townhalls"}}},{"start":1554,"length":19,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:employeeexperience"}}},{"start":1574,"length":22,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:rewardsandrecognition"}}},{"start":1597,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:personalandprofessional"}}}],"text":"It's been an incredible first half of 2024.
