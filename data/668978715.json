{"summary":"A bioengineer with 6 years of research experience in  drug and gene delivery. Trained in development and characterization of biomaterials (hydrogel) ; small molecule drug and nucleic acid (pDNA, mRNA) delivery cargos with a specific emphasis on harnessing the immune system modulation\/stimulation approach. Skilled in performing and troubleshooting molecular biology and imaging experiments  notably,  cytotoxicity , SDS-PAGE, western blot, ELISA, RT-qPCR, IF, IHC, flow cytometry, RNAseq (data analysis), SEM, confocal and fluorescence microscopy. Experienced in preclinical animal models including full thickness splinted mouse excisional wound model and mouse cancer xenograft model. Doctoral research was focused on designing an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) system facilitating high therapeutic payload and improved tumor specificity. Postdoctoral research at ASU was focused on immunomodulatory therapeutic gene delivery for skin wound healing in diabetic mouse wound models. Currently, leading the R&D division as a Senior Scientist at Adipo Therapeutics aiming at clinical translation of a nanoparticle drug product formulation targeting obesity and type 2 diabetes.","lastName":"Abedin","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:668978715","geoRegion":"Indianapolis, Indiana, United States","fullName":"Muhammad Raisul Abedin","firstName":"Muhammad Raisul","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Adipo Therapeutics","description":"\u25cf Leading the scientific team to advance the drug product into phase I and phase II clinical trials\n\u25cf Investigating the lead API loaded polymeric nanoparticle efficacy in adipose tissue browning \n\u25cf Screening the CMO manufactured nanoparticle formulations efficacy in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models\n\u25cf Developed the methods for testing nanoparticle formulation efficacy on human ex vivo biopsy samples \n\u25cf Actively collaborating with the CROs, CMOs and academic institutions","title":"Senior Formulations Scientist ","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"2-10","website":"https:\/\/adipotherapeutics.com\/","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/adipotherapeutics\/","industry":"Biotechnology Research"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:65769569","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1},"startedOn":{"month":6,"year":2023}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACffzhsBM548UIXPvOLb30CCv2osK9nZiQA,NAME_SEARCH,VJsb)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1629088795821?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=jGvcO47jYTx0sNcBOm8umVVuNT9Rl5wYfNJNrqn9yRw","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1629088795821?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=N530iZuQClnsjYmdx7LlMlzzzN4PuUKXA7I-mCpBdXE","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1629088795821?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=Efv1aOXk_TG-EtyUFG0dpFzCRM5gWJU6EhHIkeGQVbk","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1629088795821?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=k26B9u4TpOGAbgI9o89fNRpvUZEPosbLPek6O0jBHOk","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C5603AQFPq5X6AMz-Qg\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Biotechnology Research","educations":[{"endedOn":{"month":12,"year":2020},"degree":"Doctor of Philosophy -
