After that, we carried out extraction and analyzed the extract by using gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). From the result, we found that lauric, palmitic, oleic, arachidic, behenic and lignoceric acid were found in the poultry feed samples in varying amount. Lignoceric acid is the component of mustard oil.
