Although these two transcription factors are able to form two homodimers and one heterodimer, it is mainly the heterodimer that participates in the formation of this enhanceosome, binding specifically to the positive regulatory domain IV (PRDIV) site of the enhancer DNA. To understand this surprising advantage of the heterodimer, we investigated the association of these transcription factors using fragments containing the basic DNA-recognition segment and the basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP). It was found that the probability of forming the hetero-bZIP significantly exceeds the probability of forming homo-bZIPs, and that the hetero-bZIP interacts more strongly with the PRDIV site of the interferon-\u03b2 enhancer, especially in the orientation that places the folded ATF-2 basic segment in the upstream half of this asymmetric site. The effect of salt on the formation of the ATF-2\/c-Jun dimer and on its ability to bind the target PRDIV site showed that electrostatic interactions between the charged groups of these proteins and with DNA play an essential role in the formation of the asymmetric ATF-2\/c-Jun\/PRDIV complex.","publisher":"Journal of Molecular Biology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMdTVYBB-Hpk-5HJsxlQHXQ6Bvhvoefqo0,NAME_SEARCH,e8l-)"}]},{"name":"Assembling the Human Interferon-Beta Enhanceosome in Solution","publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":1,"year":2008},"description":"Assembly of interferon-beta enhanceosome from its individual protein components and of enhancer DNA has been studied in solution using a combination of fluorescence anisotropy, microcalorimetry, and CD titration. It has been shown that the enhancer binds only one full-length phosphomimetic IRF-3 dimer at the PRDIII-PRDI sites, and this binding does not exhibit cooperativity with binding of the ATF-2\/c-Jun bZIP (leucine zipper dimer with basic DNA recognition segments) heterodimer at the PRDIV site. The orientation of the bZIP pair is, therefore, not determined by the presence of the IRF-3 dimer, but is predetermined by the asymmetry of the PRDIV site. In contrast, bound IRF-3 dimer interacts strongly with the NF-kappaB (p50\/p65) heterodimer bound at the neighboring PRDII site. The orientation of bound NF-kappaB is also predetermined by the asymmetry of the PRDII site and is the opposite of that found in the crystal structure. The HMG-I\/Y protein, proposed as orchestrating enhanceosome assembly, interacts specifically with the PRDII site of the interferon-beta enhancer by inserting its DNA-binding segments (AT hooks) into the minor groove, resulting in a significant increase in NF-kappaB binding affinity for the major groove of this site.","publisher":"Journal of Molecular Biology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMdTVYBB-Hpk-5HJsxlQHXQ6Bvhvoefqo0,NAME_SEARCH,e8l-)"}]},{"name":"Unfolding of the bZIP Dimers Formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun Transcription Factors is Not a Simple Two-State Transition","publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":1,"year":2010},"description":"The varied selectivity of bZIP transcription factors stems from the fact that they are dimers consisting of two not necessarily identical subunits held together by a leucine zipper dimerization domain. Determining their stability is therefore important for understanding the mechanism of formation of these transcription factors. The most widely used approach for this problem consists of observing temperature-induced dissociation of the bZIPs by any means sensitive to their structural changes, particularly optical methods. In calculating thermodynamic characteristics of this process from such data it is usually assumed that it represents a two-state transition. However, scanning micro-calorimetric study of the temperature-induced unfolding\/dissociation of the three bZIPs formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun proteins, i.e. the two homodimers (ATF-2\/ATF-2) and (c-Jun\/c-Jun) and the heterodimer (ATF-2\/c-Jun), showed that this process does not represent a two-state transition, as found previously with the GCN4 homodimeric bZIP protein.

Glycosylation of human immunoglobulins follows a reasonably well-understood metabolic pathway, which gives rise to a diverse range of asparagine-linked (N-linked), or serine\/threonine-linked (O-linked) glycans. In N-linked glycans, fucose levels have been shown to have an inverse relationship with the degree of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and high mannose levels have been implicated in potentially increasing immunogenicity and contributing to less favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to potentially reduce the presence of high-mannose species in recombinant human immunoglobulin preparations, as well as facilitate an approximate 100% replacement of fucosylation with arabinosylation in Chinese hamster ovary cell culture through media supplementation with D-arabinose, an uncommonly used mammalian cell culture sugar substrate. The replacement of fucose with arabinose was very effective and practical to implement, since no cell line engineering or cellular adaptation strategies were required. Arabinosylated recombinant IgGs and the accompanying reduction in high mannose glycans, facilitated a reduction in dendritic cell uptake, increased Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling, and significantly increased the levels of ADCC. These aforementioned effects were without any adverse changes to various structural or functional attributes of multiple recombinant human antibodies and a bispecific DVD-Ig. Protein arabinosylation represents an expansion of the N-glycan code in mammalian expressed glycoproteins.","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/19420862.2017.1294295","name":"Arabinosylation of recombinant human immunoglobulin-based protein therapeutics","publisher":"mAbs","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMdTVYBB-Hpk-5HJsxlQHXQ6Bvhvoefqo0,NAME_SEARCH,e8l-)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"year":2024},"description":"The Arrhenius energy of activation of unfolding Ea unfolding and Gibbs free energy of unfolding \u0394G unfolding have been calculated utilizing DSC differential scanning calorimetry for 4 mAbs (1 biosimilar) in 3 formulations.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.xphs.2024.05.009","name":"DSC Derived (Ea & \u0394G) Energetics and Aggregation Predictions for mAbs","publisher":"Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMdTVYBB-Hpk-5HJsxlQHXQ6Bvhvoefqo0,NAME_SEARCH,e8l-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMMTEMBgLsrkYh4ObLVrexEXhEHVXRU6bk,NAME_SEARCH,aFAR)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":14,"year":2020},"description":"Analysis into mAb aggregate formation resulting from conformational unfolding and or colloidal interactions.\n","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-31415-6_6","name":"High-Throughput Conformational and Colloidal Stability Screening of Biologic Molecules","publisher":"Springer, Cham ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMdTVYBB-Hpk-5HJsxlQHXQ6Bvhvoefqo0,NAME_SEARCH,e8l-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEcBmMBbWyW_Z2y_ZjTMpK5A5aHl8pC_NM,NAME_SEARCH,t2S6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAaGMtkBYIBIo0XTekUVfC8GBBxHXVwk0Xs,NAME_SEARCH,kHLk)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABMHdLIBscyw6D15uiQGMSv3PelIU1RwI5k,NAME_SEARCH,2YVu)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":28,"year":2023},"description":"Polysorbate degradation in biotherapeutics formulations is an industry-wide problem and mainly caused by residual host cell-derived enzymes.

Amgen\u2019s Amjevita was the first of 9 biosimilar competitors that have launched in the US market. \n\nAbbVie has been preparing for Humira\u2019s LOE for years, and has a strong pipeline in immunology, including two other top 10 medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which together achieved more than $11B in sales, a ~$4B increase from 2022.\n\nSanofi\u2019s Dupixent continued to set records and recently saw a new FDA approval for pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis. \n\nIt also had positive Phase 3 trial results for COPD, which is notable given if it gets to approval, it would be the first biologic treatment approved for that condition. \n\nFinding out just how profitable a single blockbuster can be is often a challenge, but diving into Regeneron\u2019s financials sheds light on just how profitable Dupixent is: \n\nSince Sanofi and Regeneron are partners, Sanofi records revenue worldwide, while Regeneron reports only its share of profits, which is 50% on US sales, and between 35-45% on international sales. \n\nIn 2023, Regeneron recorded $3.1B in profits from its antibody collaboration with Sanofi \u2013 add on Sanofi\u2019s share of profits, and Dupixent likely generates more than ~$6B in combined profit per year. \n\nDupixent\u2019s patents run until 2031, so Sanofi and Regeneron have several years of strong growth ahead for their star franchise.\n\nOn the other hand, J&J\u2019s blockbuster Stelara will face competition in 2025, notable given the drug accounts for ~20% of J&J\u2019s pharma revenue.\n\nOne of the more exciting developments in immunology is the use of cell therapies for autoimmune conditions, particularly lupus. \n\n\nWhile there is a long way to go before commercialization, early studies have yielded impressive results, which leaves open the possibility that one day, some of the top 10 might be cell therapies."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7183854208490577921"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7184003804000841728"}}},{"createdAt":1712664420000,"insightId":"52c0df64-e0ac-4463-ac89-008e30f33d79","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":14},{"type":"INTEREST","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183435324298072064","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183435324298072064","reactionsCount":15,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183435323639574528","message":{"attributes":[{"start":139,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:330447659"}}},{"start":152,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oncologydrugs"}}}],"text":"Oncology drugs market in the global biopharma industry worth over $200B.
