{"summary":"I am driven by passion for science and innovation. My curiosity has led me to explore emerging areas at the forefront of science and technology. Some of my previous research projects included applying a proprietary protein array-based method to determine the glycosylation patterns of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins. I also investigated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, seeking insights into mitochondria disorders, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. More recently, I collaborated with LMU, to develop RNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. \n\nI have extensive hands-on experience in chromatography methods, production, characterization and purification of recombinant proteins to support crystallography, biophysical studies and enzymatic assays.\n\nTwo of my favorite quotes are: \"Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity \u2013 not a threat.\" - Steve Jobs and \"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'\" - Isaac Asimov. These quotes celebrate the spirit of curiosity, discovery, and pushing the boundaries of knowledge through science and innovation","lastName":"Kolog
