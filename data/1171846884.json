Clinically, renal fusion anomalies are often found incidentally and associated with increased risk for complications, such as urinary tract obstruction, infection and urolithiasis. These anomalies are most commonly imaged using ultrasound for anatomical definition and less frequently using renal scintigraphy to quantify differential renal function and assess urinary tract drainage. Functional magnetic resonance urography (fMRU) is an advanced imaging technique that combines the excellent soft-tissue contrast of conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images with the quantitative assessment based on contrast medium uptake and excretion kinetics to provide information on renal function and drainage. fMRU has been shown to be clinically useful in evaluating a number of urological conditions. A highly sensitive and radiation-free imaging modality, fMRU can provide detailed morphological and functional information that can facilitate conservative and\/or surgical management of children with renal fusion anomalies. This paper reviews the embryological basis of the different types of renal fusion anomalies, their imaging appearances at fMRU, complications associated with fusion anomalies, and the important role of fMRU in diagnosing and managing children with these anomalies.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00247-017-3927-5","name":"Role of magnetic resonance urography in pediatric renal fusion anomalies","publisher":"Pediatric Radiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAEXY9uQBwrNnVqZBZn30Eg8kOtFAWKXcb58,NAME_SEARCH,ovIi)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":1,"year":2021},"description":"Functional renal imaging, most commonly with MAG3 nuclear medicine renal scan, is recommended in the evaluation of children with urinary tract dilation (UTD) suspected of obstructive uropathy.

Unfortunately, there is no effective management for TBI in the acute setting. Rodent studies have shown that xenon, a well-known anesthetic gas, can be neuroprotective when administered post-TBI. Gas inhalation therapy, however, the approach typically used for administering xenon, is expensive, inconvenient, and fraught with systemic side effects. Therapeutic delivery to the brain is minimal, with much of the inhaled gas cleared by the lungs. To bridge major gaps in clinical care and enhance cerebral delivery of xenon, this study introduces a novel xenon delivery technique, utilizing microbubbles, in which a high impulse ultrasound signal is used for targeted cerebral release of xenon. Briefly, an ultrasound pulse is applied along the carotid artery at the level of the neck on intravenous injection of xenon microbubbles (XeMBs) resulting in release of xenon from microbubbles into the brain. This delivery technique employs a hand-held, portable ultrasound system that could be adopted in resource-limited environments.

Currently, the most widely used relaxometry methods for iron quantification are R2 and R2*, which are based on T2 and T2* acquisition sequences, respectively. We compared the rate of change of LIC as measured by the R2-based, FDA-approved commercially available third-party software with the rate of change of LIC measured by in-house analysis using R2*-relaxometry-based MR imaging in patients undergoing follow-up MRI scans for liver iron estimation. Methods: We retrospectively included patients who had undergone serial MRIs for liver iron estimation. The MR studies were performed on a 1.5T scanner; standard multi-slice, multi-echo T2- and T2*-based sequences were acquired, and LIC was estimated. The comparison between the rate of change of LIC by R2 and R2* values was performed via correlation coefficients and Bland\u2013Altman difference plots. Results: One hundred and eighty-nine MR abdomen studies for liver iron evaluation from 81 patients (male: 38; female: 43) were included in the study.
