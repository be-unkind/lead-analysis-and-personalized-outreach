Principally, the low-noise amplifier (LNA), that is the first block on the receiver chain, must tolerate interference and guarantee high sensitivity. Linearization techniques must tackle several challenges such as adding minimum power consumption, preserving noise figure, and maintaining high matching and gain. In this article, a digital dual-path component based linearization technique will be introduced. The linearization is implemented by adding a nonlinear auxiliary path along with two constant coefficients used to cancel out the third order nonlinearities from the main path.

The signal-component cancellation uses two coefficients that are found adaptively with a novel two-step LMS algorithm in the digital domain. In contrast with previous prominent approaches based on an auxiliary path, the proposed linearization has two significant advantages: 1) it does not estimate the signal nonlinearities used in other techniques for cancellation, and 2) upon convergence of the adaptive algorithm, the digital solution is input-signal independent and therefore is static in steady-state.","url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/8885260","name":"Blocker-Tolerant RF-to-Digital Linearization With aVery Nonlinear Auxiliary Path","publisher":"IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvysvQBtGLanEEKmKBMIWqzb3P1knpz2Ak,NAME_SEARCH,aCq6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA6hOFgB6n1x21zqteqXvBM662uU9uvqatM,NAME_SEARCH,YgHt)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-y2z8Bj0a7Qn1yKHv5r-M7evgf-9aiIag,NAME_SEARCH,19Ms)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACVuM3UBgUMdtNTnBrGP_ggnJ1fH0i2q60c,NAME_SEARCH,gzrq)"}]},{"name":"Kalman-Based Real-Time Functional Decomposition for the Spectral Calibration in Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography","publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":10,"year":2019},"description":"This paper presents a real-time functional decomposition adaptive algorithm for the optimal sampling of the interferometric signal in Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography imaging systems, which completely eliminates the input signal dependent nonlinearities that are problematic in current state-of-the-art OCT realizations that\nuse interpolation and resampling.
