We tested whether kidney T2 values and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are superior to anatomical imaging parameters in the detection of early cystogenesis, as shown on macro- and histopathology.

Furthermore, kidney T2 values exhibited a nearly perfect correlation to the histological cystic index, allowing a clear separation of the two mouse genotypes. Additionally, kidney T2 values and ADC were able to monitor early treatment effects in the jck mouse model in a proof-of-principle experiment.

Methods: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional analysis of patients\u2019 anxiety and the underlying causes of anxiety prior to a CCTA-scan, including 325 patients. Questions concerning the patients\u2019 state of anxiety and the underlying causes were asked by the radiologist during the standard informed consent prior to the CCTA-examination. Statistical analysis was performed including patient-related factors. Results: In total, 47.3% of patients reported a feeling of anxiety before undergoing CCTA (n=146). Anxiety showed much higher prevalence in women than in men (60.0% vs. 39.1%, p<0.005). The majority of anxious patients were afraid about the potential diagnosis of CAD (41.7% of women, 51.4% of men). The second most frequent cause of anxiety was claustrophobia (19.4% of women, 23.0% of men), immediately followed by fear about the admission of contrast material (15.3% of women, 13.5% of men). 9.7% of women and 5.4% of men were scared of radiation, and 2.8% of women \/ 1.4% of men expressed fear of intravenous needle placement. Conclusion: The results of our study underline that CCTA-related anxiety is relevant and not negligible, especially in women. Hence, the assumption that CT does not possess a relevant anxiogenic potential and therefore does not require specific anxiety-moderating measures should be challenged.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4172\/2324-8602.1000298","name":"Causes of Anxiety in Patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography.","publisher":"Int J Cardiovasc Res 6:1","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABvpDC0Bp5ACZVWqb1smHY9jU4wgFw2Ack0,NAME_SEARCH,lvZP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7uybsB2MUXCE5q_RLIWw_O9Z-hFsfK2dY,NAME_SEARCH,g0kP)"}]},{"name":"63-j\u00e4hriger Mann mit Dyspnoe und Rechtsherzinsuffizienz","publishedOn":{"year":2016},"publisher":"DMW 141(14), pp.1005-1005","url":"https:\/\/www.thieme.de\/de\/innere-medizin\/dyspnoe-rechtsherzinsuffizienz-102356.htm","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABvpDC0Bp5ACZVWqb1smHY9jU4wgFw2Ack0,NAME_SEARCH,lvZP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7uybsB2MUXCE5q_RLIWw_O9Z-hFsfK2dY,NAME_SEARCH,g0kP)"}]},{"name":"Abnorme Gadolinium-Kinetik im Kardio-MRT - immer ein Hinweis auf kardiale Amyloidose?
