To elucidate the role of ABRAXAS in the DNA repair process, we characterized the ABRAXAS wild type and Arg361Gln mutant using in silico and in vitro approach.

Here, we carried out a comprehensive examination of MERIT40 biophysical properties and identified its novel interacting partner which would help to understand its role in BRCA1-complex. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and the unfolding pathway was determined using spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. The molecular model was generated using combinatorial approaches of modeling, and monomer-monomer docking was carried out to identify the dimeric interface. The disordered region of MERIT40 was hatchet using trypsin and chymotrypsin to illustrate the existence of a stable domain whose function was speculated through DALI search. Our findings suggest that MERIT40 forms a dimer in a concentration-independent manner. Its central region shows remarkable stability towards the protease digestion and has structural similarity with the vWA-like region, a domain mainly present in complement activation factors. MERIT40 undergoes a three-state unfolding transition pathway with a dimeric intermediate. It interacts with adaptor molecule of BRCA1-complex, called ABRAXAS, thus help in extending the bridging interaction among various members which further stabilizes the whole complex.

These longitudinal protofilaments are made up of intra- (\u03b1-\u03b2) and inter-dimer (\u03b2-\u03b1) interactions. Literature review confirms that GTP hydrolysis results in considerable structural rearrangement within the GTP binding site of \u03b2-\u03b1 dimer interface after the release of \u03b3 phosphate. In addition to this, the intra-dimer interface exhibits structural rigidity which needs further investigation. In this study, we explored the reasons for the flexibility and the rigidity of the \u03b2-\u03b1 dimer and the \u03b1-\u03b2 dimer respectively through molecular simulation and Anisotropic Normal Mode based analysis. As per the sequence alignment report, two glycine residues (Gly96 and Gly98) were observed in the T3 loop of the \u03b2 subunit which gets substituted by Asp98 and Ala100 in the T3 loop of the \u03b1 subunit. The higher mobility of glycine residues contributes to the flexibility of the T3 loop of inter-dimer when they come in direct contact with the GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain of the subunit. This was confirmed through RMSD, RMSF, and Radius of Gyration based studies. Conversely, the intra-dimer exhibited lower mobility in the absence of glycine residues. As per ANM based analysis, positive domain correlations were observed between T3 loop and GAP domain of intra- and inter- dimeric contact regions. However, these correlation motions were higher in the intra-dimer as compared to the inter-dimer interface. Thus on the basis of our findings, we hypothesize that the higher flexibility of T3 loop and the GAP domain of the inter-dimer is required for structural rearrangement and protofilament stability during hydrolysis. Furthermore, the slightly rigid nature of the T3 loop and the GAP domain of the intra-dimer assists in enhancing the monomer-monomer interaction through the higher positive domain correlation.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1476927117308423?via%3Dihub","name":"Insights into the flexibility of the T3 loop and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain of dimeric \u03b1 and \u03b2 tubulins from a molecular dynamics perspective","publisher":"ELSEVIER","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGu6EQBGMnvBY228HL2CGTdHUeymiBAQag,NAME_SEARCH,ihGt)"}]},{"name":"A Novel Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) Targeting Cell Surface Heat Shock Protein 70 (csHSP70) Is Active Against Pre-Clinical Models of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL)","description":"Neoplasms of T-cell or natural killer\/T-cell origin account for 10-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the United States, and 30% or more of NHLs in African and Asian countries, and tumors from post-thymic or peripheral T-cells are referred to collectively as PTCLs.

Publically available databases were also leveraged, including the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), as well as our own RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from primary PTCL samples. Results: We examined the cell surface proteome of SUD-HL-1 (ALK+ ALCL), Mac-1 (ALK- ALCL), HH (CTCL), and HuT 78 (Mycosis fungoides with S\u00e9zary syndrome) cells by biotinylation and then mass spectrometry, and identified csHSP70 as being consistently expressed in all four lines. Analysis of the CCLE showed that HSP70 mRNA and HSP70 protein was expressed at the highest level in T-cell lymphoma cell lines, and our own RNA-Seq data confirmed HSP70 gene expression was higher in primary PTCL samples, and especially in ALCLs, compared with normal T-cells.","publisher":"Blood","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/356486083_A_Novel_Antibody_Drug_Conjugate_ADC_Targeting_Cell_Surface_Heat_Shock_Protein_70_csHSP70_Is_Active_Against_Pre-Clinical_Models_of_Peripheral_T-Cell_Lymphoma_PTCL","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGu6EQBGMnvBY228HL2CGTdHUeymiBAQag,NAME_SEARCH,ihGt)"}]},{"name":"Novel Anti-B-cell Maturation Antigen Alpha-Amanitin Antibody-drug Conjugate HDP-101 Shows Superior Activity to Belantamab Mafodotin and Enhanced Efficacy in Deletion 17p Myeloma Models","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":16,"year":2024},"url":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-3843028\/v1","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGu6EQBGMnvBY228HL2CGTdHUeymiBAQag,NAME_SEARCH,ihGt)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714810080000,"insightId":"5d30fe94-762a-4951-af79-de0ec293d57f","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7192434781626761216","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7192434781626761216","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7192434781626761216","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"CFBR"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:jobSeeker:urn:li:member:397168912"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7192139884793315328","message":{"attributes":[{"length":11,"start":294,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:opentowork"}}}],"text":"Hey everyone!
