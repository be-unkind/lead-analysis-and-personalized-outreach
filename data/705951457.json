(2024 DOI: 10.20944\/preprints202401.0747.v1 ) EWB is defined as the quality-of-life characterized by living well and dying well within the context of human suffering and death. Different from subjective psychological wellbeing, people with a high level of EWB are able to see the stars in the darkest night, enjoy inner peace in the midst of storms, and maintain an inner state of harmony, balance and contentment (Wong & Bowers, 1989).\nEWB depends on some combination of the following experiences: (1) Enduring and overcoming adversity; (2) Existential intelligence (Gardner, 2020) and wisdom of the soul (Wong 2022a; Wong, Ho, et al, 2023a) to adapt well to whatever life throws at you. (3) Spiritual\/ religious resources and values such as faith, hope, and love (Wong,2023); (4) the capability to transcend and transform suffering though meaning-focused coping (Eisenbeck et al., 2021); and self-transcendence (Wong, Arslan et al., 2021).
