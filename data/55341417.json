Many patients require second and third line therapy due to toxicity, tolerability, failure, or a combination of factors. The need for third line HAART, essential for program planning, is not known.\nMethods: Antiretroviral-na\u0131\u00a8ve patients $18 years who started first HAART after January 1, 2000 in Caribbean, Central and South America Network (CCASAnet) sites in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. Clinical trials participants were excluded. Third line HAART was defined as use of darunavir, tipranavir, etravirine, enfuvirtide, maraviroc or raltegravir. Need for third line HAART was defined as virologic failure while on second line HAART.\nResults: Of 5853 HAART initiators followed for a median of 3.5 years, 310 (5.3%) failed a second line regimen and 44 (0.8%) received a third line regimen. Cumulative incidence of failing a 2nd or starting a 3rd line regimen was 2.7% and 6.0% three and five years after HAART initiation, respectively. Predictors at HAART initiation for failing a second or starting a third line\nincluded female sex (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18\u20132.00, p = 0.001), younger age (HR = 2.76 for 20 vs. 40 years, 95% CI 1.86\u20134.10, p,0.001), and prior AIDS (HR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.62\u20132.90, p,0.001).\nConclusions: Third line regimens may be needed for at least 6% of patients in Latin America within 5 years of starting HAART, a substantial proportion given the large numbers of patients on HAART in the region. Improved accessibility to third line regimens is warranted.","url":"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106887","name":"Use of Third Line Antiretroviral Therapy in Latin America","publisher":"PLOS ONE","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJBcn0BSov8uAFLS4X6c9-3smwCzlPM8nw,NAME_SEARCH,zx1l)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAabB-4BQMMgiAR3YQvIiVGQxLF5JeMTiZM,NAME_SEARCH,5-jx)"}]},{"name":"Cluster of Imported Vivax Malaria in Travelers Returning From Peru","publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":10,"year":2015},"publisher":"J Travel Med","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26354673","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAhtP8MB5aP1ZlCkhA5XANTskGrppw6KtLM,NAME_SEARCH,MzJt)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA74Y5gBhszZhtDQzMWoI7K18VOfTsZKKOE,NAME_SEARCH,8BSF)"}]},{"name":"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Latin-American immigrants: comparative analysis from clinical records in a clinical care centre in Santiago in the last decade].","publishedOn":{"month":2,"year":2015},"publisher":"Rev Chilena Infectolog\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25860155","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":17,"year":2013},"description":"Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo analyze the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection and its influence on mortality and treatment outcome within a large AIDS cohort in Chile.\nMETHODS:\nClinical and epidemiological data from the Chilean AIDS Cohort were retrospectively analyzed. Adult patients tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during the time period of October 2001 to October 2007 were included.\nRESULTS:\nOf 5115 cohort patients, 1907 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of HBV co-infection was 8.4%.

Cancer cases were classified as AIDS-defining cancers (ADC) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC). The association of mortality with cancer- and HIV-related factors was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models stratified by clinic site and cancer type.\n\nRESULTS:\nAmong 15,869 patients, 783 had an eligible cancer diagnosis; 82% were male and median age at cancer diagnosis was 39 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 32-47). Patients were from Brazil (36.5%), Argentina (19.9%), Chile (19.7%), Mexico (19.3%), and Honduras (4.6%). A total of 564 ADC and 219 NADC were diagnosed. Patients with NADC had similar survival probabilities as those with ADC at one year (81% vs. 79%) but lower survival at five years (60% vs. 69%). In the adjusted analysis, risk of mortality increased with detectable viral load (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]\u2009=\u20091.63, p\u2009=\u20090.02), age (aHR\u2009=\u20091.02 per year, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and time between HIV and cancer diagnoses (aHR\u2009=\u20091.03 per year, p\u2009=\u20090.01).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nADC remain the most frequent cancers in the region. Overall mortality was related to detectable viral load and age. Longer-term survival was lower after diagnosis of NADC than for ADC, which may be due to factors unrelated to HIV.","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/29760767","name":"Survival after cancer diagnosis in a cohort of HIV-positive individuals in Latin America.","publisher":"Infect Agent Cancer. 2018 May 8;13:16","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"year":2018},"description":"Early retention in care, sex, and sexual mode of HIV acquisition has been associated with mortality risk among persons living with HIV (PLWH).

ART-na\u00efve, adult PLWH (\u226518 years) enrolling at Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic sites 2000-2015, starting ART, and with \u22651 visit after ART-start were included. Early retention in care was defined as \u22652 HIV care visits\/labs \u226590 days apart in the first year of ART. Cox models assessed the association between early retention in care, sex, and sexual mode of HIV acquisition [i.e., women, heterosexual men and men who have sex with men (MSM)], and mortality.

The aim of this study was to describe epidemiologic and clinical features of candidemia in children and adults in tertiary level hospitals in Chile.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a prospective, multicenter, laboratory-based survey study of candidemia in 26 tertiary care hospitals in Chile, from January 2013 to October 2017.\n\nRESULTS:\nA total of 780 episodes of candidemia were included, with a median incidence of 0.47\/1,000 admissions. Demographic, clinical and microbiological information of 384 cases of candidemia, from 18 hospitals (7,416 beds), was included in this report. One hundred and thirty-four episodes (35%) occurred in pediatric patients and 250 (65%) in adult population. Candida albicans (39%), Candida parapsilosis (30%) and Candida glabrata (10%) were the leading species, with a significant difference in the distribution of species between ages. The use of central venous catheter and antibiotics were the most frequent risk factors in all age groups (> 70%). Three hundred and fifteen strains were studied for antifungal susceptibility; 21 strains (6.6%) were resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin or micafungin. The most commonly used antifungal therapies were fluconazole (39%) and echinocandins (36%). The overall 30-day survival was 74.2%, significantly higher in infants (82%) and children (86%) compared with neonates (72%), adults (71%) and elderly (70%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur prospective, multicenter surveillance study showed a low incidence of candidemia in Chile, with high 30-day survival, a large proportion of elderly patients, C. glabrata as the third most commonly identified strain, a 6.6% resistance to antifungal agents and a frequent use of echinocandins.","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30849092\/","name":"A prospective, multi-center study of Candida bloodstream infections in Chile.","publisher":"PLoS One. 2019 Mar 8;14(3):e0212924.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"name":"My bibliography NCBI (Pubmed)","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/myncbi\/claudia%20p..cortes.1\/bibliography\/public\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"name":"list of publications","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/myncbi\/claudia%20p..cortes.1\/bibliography\/public\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"name":"Lessons learned from over a decade of data audits in international observational HIV cohorts in Latin America and East Africa","publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":3,"year":2023},"publisher":"J Clin Transl Sci . 2023 Nov 3;7(1):e245. doi: 10.1017\/cts.2023.659. eCollection 2023.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38033704\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"name":"Humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 evoked by heterologous vaccination groups using the CoronaVac (Sinovac) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer\/BioNTech) vaccines in Chile","publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":24,"year":2023},"publisher":"Front Public Health . 2023 Aug 24:11:1229045. doi: 10.3389\/fpubh.2023.1229045. eCollection 2023.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37693706\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANMcWkBxN3JCt8X7iu4jx495zrv6IjWWx8,NAME_SEARCH,Tc2g)"}]},{"name":"Practical management of complexity in older people with HIV: approaching an international consensus","publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":1,"year":2023},"publisher":"AIDS Care . 2023 Aug;35(8):1149-1153. doi: 10.1080\/09540121.2023.2190956.
