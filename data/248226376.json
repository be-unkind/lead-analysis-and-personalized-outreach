To determine the role of HIV-associated immune suppression on HPV persistence and pathogenesis, and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the modulation of HPV infection and oral cancer by HIV, we developed a mathematical model of HIV\/HPV co-infection. Our model captures known immunological and molecular features such as impaired HPV-specific effector T helper 1 (Th1) cell responses, and enhanced HPV infection due to HIV. We used the model to determine HPV prognosis in the presence of HIV infection, and identified conditions under which HIV infection alters HPV persistence in the oral mucosa system. The model predicts that conditions leading to HPV persistence during HIV\/HPV co-infection are the permissive immune environment created by HIV and molecular interactions between the two viruses. The model also determines when HPV infection continues to persist in the short run in a co-infected patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, the model predicts that, under efficacious antiretroviral treatment, HPV infections will decrease in the long run due to the restoration of CD4+ T cell numbers and protective immune responses.","url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168133","name":"Modeling the Mechanisms by Which HIV-Associated Immunosuppression Influences HPV Persistence at the Oral Mucosa","publisher":"PLOS.org \/ PLOS ONE","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7LokgB8JnSYAAhYVZJvF_6qQ67YtJ3QJI,NAME_SEARCH,gOJK)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":2,"year":2017},"description":"Cell biology is increasingly evolving to become a more formal and quantitative science. The field of\nintracellular transport is no exception.

The two major strategies employed to represent intracellular trafficking are based on \u201cordinary differential equations\u201d and \u201cagent-\u201d based modeling. Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks.

Additionally, current treatments were designed based on the average patient using the \u201cone size fits all\u201d protocol. Therefore, they can be effective on some patients but not for others. There is an urgent need to replace such generalized approaches with personalized and predictive strategies that capture and analyze human diversity and variation at a resolution sufficient to identify and clinically validate personalized treatment paradigms. Utilization of heterogenous datasets, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), to build synthetic populations of patients and personalized, predictive models of response to therapy holds enormous promise in precipitating a revolution in precision medicine for IBD. In silico trials can be designed to include multi-modal data sources, including clinical trial data at the individual and aggregated levels, pre-clinical data from animal studies, as well as data from EHR.

An estimated 85% of H. pylori\u2013colonized individuals experience no detrimental effects. To study the mechanisms promoting host tolerance to the bacterium in the gastrointestinal mucosa and systemic regulatory effects, we investigated the dynamics of immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by H. pylori using a high-performance computing\u2013driven ENteric Immunity SImulator multiscale model. Immune responses were simulated by integrating an agent-based model, ordinary, and partial differential equations.\nResults - The outputs were analyzed using 2 sequential stages: the first used a partial rank correlation coefficient regression\u2013based and the second a metamodel-based global sensitivity analysis. The influential parameters screened from the first stage were selected to be varied for the second stage. The outputs from both stages were combined as a training dataset to build a spatiotemporal metamodel. The Sobol indices measured time-varying impact of input parameters during initiation, peak, and chronic phases of infection. The study identified epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial cell death as key parameters that control infection outcomes. In silico validation showed that colonization with H. pylori decreased with a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation, which was linked to regulatory macrophages and tolerogenic dendritic cells.\nConclusions - The hybrid model of H. pylori infection identified epithelial cell proliferation as a key factor for successful colonization of the gastric niche and highlighted the role of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory macrophages in modulating the host responses and shaping infection outcomes.","url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/gigascience\/article\/8\/6\/giz062\/5513894#136711643","name":"High-resolution computational modeling of immune responses in the
