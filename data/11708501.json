It was late evening when my pager notified me that I was wanted urgently on the general medicine ward. Arriving at the ward, I learned that John (not his real name), an 82-year old man with early-mid Alzheimer's disease, was \u201csundowning\u201d; he had become increasingly confused and paranoid, and had grabbed a nurse, dragging her under his bed. He was shielding her with his arm wrapped around her, saying that he was protecting her from enemy soldiers. They were lying motionless beneath the bed \u2013 \u201chiding\u201d. There are some things medical school does not teach you. While I was considering my options, Anna, John's wife of more than 60\u2005years, arrived. She lived nearby, and when notified that John was behaving unusually, had returned to the hospital. Upon being appraised of the situation, she sighed, tearfully saying \u201cHe's re-living his nightmare, that dreadful day in 1918 during the First World War.\u201d I asked Anna for information about this nightmare. Anna told me that over their six decades of marriage John had recounted this story only three times, and had struggled emotionally each time. As I pressed her for details, she began to relate the events of a day 63\u2005years earlier. Clearing her throat, Anna started: \u201cIt was late September 1918, and John was stationed in northern France. Several weeks earlier he had again been injured \u2013 knocked unconscious \u2013 during an artillery barrage and had been recuperating behind the lines. Since he was suffering from severe headaches and wasn't ready for active service, they decided to use him as a stretcher bearer during the current offensive. Their forces had pushed the opposing line into a retreat, and he was shuttling injured soldiers back to a field hospital. Several nurses were also present for triaging and first aid. John was on his fourth trip and was standing in a trench talking to a nurse, when unexpectedly a counterattack occurred as enemy troops tried to retake a strategic foothold. John and the nurse looked down the trench and could see soldiers descending the parapet wall. In an attempt to escape, John and the nurse ran in the opposite direction, along the trench duckboards, looking for cover or a means of escape. The nurse noticed a small storage trench extending away from the main trench line. She grabbed John's arm, guiding him into this hiding spot, and the two of them clambered to the back of the storage trench. With bloated rats scurrying in every direction, they lay down in the mud of the trench, she with her back against the rear wall and John in front. To hide, they pulled some stretchers over themselves. She wrapped her arm around John's waist. John and the nurse remained hidden with the lice and mice for about 10\u201320 minutes. Believing that all was safe, they emerged and re-entered the trench, where they were surprised to encounter a lone enemy soldier, who appeared to be a teenage boy, ravenously eating from a tin of beef and searching for more food. In the ensuing struggle, John prevailed. Pausing and returning to 1981, Anna tearfully continued her story: \u201cJohn came home to me in 1919, a changed man, but I married him, my childhood sweetheart. Thankfully, unlike many of his comrades, he did not resort to alcohol or violence. John and I suffered, endured, and flourished together. At first his nightmares of that day were frequent, but by the 1930s he was managing rather well. In the 1940s, John came across a poem by Siegfried Sassoon. 1 John often quoted the last four lines of this poem: You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by, The hell where youth and laughter go. John liked this poem. He said it was therapeutic for him. From the 1950s onwards, we have had a good life together. But that has changed recently. His Alzheimer's disease is weakening him, and as his mind and thought clarity declines, he is increasingly confused and has lost the ability to suppress his personal horrors. Trench life was harsh \u2013 cruelty flourished, compassion suffocated, feelings were futile \u2013 John wants to forget it, but now he can't. He is regressing to my lonely, frightened boy in the trenches.\u201d I stood there, sombre, deeply moved. However, I at least appreciated the problem and formulated a practical approach to this situation. I walked into John's room, speaking slowly and firmly. \u201cAll is clear. The enemy is gone.\u201d I said in as authoritative voice as I could muster. \u201cIt's safe?\u201d came John's whispered query. \u201cYes, it's over, you're both safe.\u201d I replied. John released his arm from the nurse who soon scrambled from under the far side of the bed. I peered under the bed directly into John's eyes \u2013 his look of anguish and terror and horror was truly heart-wrenching. \u201cFor Mercy's sake, help me. I can't remember anything but misery, I'm scared. Is there a pill to help me? Please find a cure, find something, help me \u2026 please help me\u201d implored John in a wretched and pathetic plea. I was young, I promised him I would. I knelt beside the bed, staring intensely into his eyes and holding his hand. That exact moment in time \u2013 \u201cThe Moment\u201d \u2013 has lived with me ever since. I cannot forget his abject look of terror and his pitiful, plaintive plea. At that precise moment, I knew I had to do something for the treatment of dementia. I knew I had to become a chemist. Though the remainder of the night was quiet, I did not sleep. That night, I wrote my first \u201ctherapeutic poem\u201d. Since I had no useful medications, the least I could do in the short term was \u201cinvent\u201d a poem (rather than a drug molecule) \u2013 words meant to be helpful and supportive for a person in need. My poem for John was as follows: There are no wars to end all wars, And every war is like the last; Scorched souls and human shells remain; For those who fought, for all the souls Their sacrifice and courage great, We must abhor war's carnage strife, We must embrace each human life. The following afternoon I returned to visit John and give him his poem. Although he didn't recognize me, he seemed aware that he had experienced one of his nightmares and wanted to talk. \u201cMy life was saved by a nurse. You know, I don't even remember her name. And I confronted a young soldier, a teenager like me, but he looked even younger, maybe 16. I can still see his face. I can still remember looking into his eyes. The events of that day have haunted me and our marriage ever since. And the nightmares\u2026 thought I had beaten them down, but they're coming back. This dementia, the confusion and the memory loss for things I want to remember, it's crushing me, it's awful\u2026 awful, awful.\u201d I handed John the poem. He read it. He smiled, and then he cried. Thanking me, John grasped my hand. \u201cIt seems we cannot cure humanity of war, but maybe you have a chance at dementia. Please \u2026 may my misery, our misery [looking at Anna] not have been in vain. Please help.\u201d","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/cmdc.202400074","title":"Chemists Invent Drugs and Drugs Save Lives","sourceDomain":"chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7185701948128473090","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"If you read one thing today, make it this devastatingly moving editorial from Donald Weaver.
