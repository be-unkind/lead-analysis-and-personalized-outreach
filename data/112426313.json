Opal Sandy was born unable to hear anything due to auditory neuropathy, a condition that disrupts nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain and can be caused by a faulty gene. But after receiving an infusion containing a working copy of the gene during groundbreaking surgery that took just 16 minutes, the 18-month-old can hear almost perfectly and enjoys playing with toy drums. Her parents were left \u201cgobsmacked\u201d when they realised she could hear for the first time after the treatment. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really believe it,\u201d Opal\u2019s mother, Jo Sandy, said. \u201cIt was \u2026 bonkers.\u201d The girl, from Oxfordshire, was treated at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital, part of Cambridge university hospitals NHS foundation trust, which is running the Chord trial . More deaf children from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will all be followed up for five years. Prof Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at the trust and chief investigator for the trial, said the initial results were \u201cbetter than I hoped or expected\u201d and could cure patients with this type of deafness. \u201cWe have results from [Opal] which are very spectacular \u2013 so close to normal hearing restoration. So we do hope it could be a potential cure.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been so much work, decades of work \u2026 to finally see something that actually worked in humans \u2026. It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.\u201d Auditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which makes a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. To overcome the fault, the new therapy from biotech firm Regeneron sends a working copy of the gene to the ear. A second child has also recently received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge university hospitals, with positive results. The overall Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children including Opal receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only. A different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time. In total, 18 children worldwide will be recruited to the trial. Opal is the first patient globally to receive the therapy and is \u201cthe youngest globally that\u2019s been done to date as far as we know\u201d, Bance said. The gene therapy \u2013 DB-OTO \u2013 is specifically for children with OTOF mutations. A harmless virus is used to carry the working gene into the patient. The trial is \u201cjust the beginning of gene therapies\u201d, Bance said. \u201cIt marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.\u201d Martin McLean, a senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society, said deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment. \u201cMany families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated.\u201d With Opal\u2019s hearing restored, her parents now have a fresh problem to contend with: their daughter\u2019s new favourite hobby is slamming cutlery on the table to make as much noise as possible.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/article\/2024\/may\/09\/uk-toddler-has-hearing-restored-in-world-first-gene-therapy-trial","title":"UK toddler has hearing restored in world first gene therapy trial","sourceDomain":"theguardian.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":35},{"type":"PRAISE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194374208133464065","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194374208133464065","reactionsCount":36,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194374207659458561","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Breakthrough Gene therapy drug cures born deaf in one year old child.\n\nOpal is the first patient globally to receive the therapy and is \u201cthe youngest globally that\u2019s been done to date as far as we know\u201d.\n\nGiven as an infusion into the ear, the therapy replaces faulty DNA causing her type of inherited deafness.\n\nThe gene therapy \u2013 DB-OTO \u2013 is specifically for children with OTOF mutations.

Hangzhou Jiuyuan Gene Engineering said in a post , opens new tab on Wednesday on its official social media account that the application for drug it calls Jiyoutai was for usage to control blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. An approval of Jiyoutai would make the injectible China's first locally developed biosimilar semaglutide drug. A biosimilar drug has a structure that closely mimics an existing drug but is not exactly alike. Semaglutide, developed by Novo Nordisk, is the active ingredient in Ozempic as well as the Danish firm's powerful weight-loss drug Wegovy. The application for approval by Jiuyuan Gene Engineering comes amid surging demand for semaglutide that far outpaces supply globally. Jiuyuan Gene, which is majority owned by China's Huadong Medicine (000963.SZ) , opens new tab , completed a late-stage clinical trial in China last year comparing its semaglutide injection with Ozempic in a group of 476 patients, according to a clinical trials registry , opens new tab . The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on Jiyoutai's safety or efficacy data. A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, whose patent in China for Ozempic is not set to expire until 2026 but is contested in court, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jiuyuan Gene Engineering collaborated with its top shareholder Huadong Medicine to develop another diabetes drug which is approved in China.
