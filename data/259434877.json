ProQR is focused on the development of life changing RNA therapies to meet the unmet need of individuals and families with common and rare diseases. A team of 150+ enthusiastic ProQRians from all walks of life and more than 30 different nationalities is up to this challenge. We have the passion and commitment to make a difference in the lives of the communities we serve. Our proprietary Axiomer\u00ae RNA editing technology platform enables the editing of specific single nucleotides in RNA using the cells own editing machinery. Axiomer\u00ae RNA editing technology harnesses ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA), which is machinery present in all human cells to repair G-to-A mutations, modulate protein, and enable protective mutation functions. Axiomer could potentially yield a new class of innovative medicines and treat currently untreatable diseases. Our R&D department is currently looking for an experienced Senior Scientist Bioinformatics to join our team in Leiden. The Senior Scientist Bioinformatics will lead bioinformatics activities that support the wet-lab colleagues with the analysis of transcriptomics studies, will develop and optimize (new) ( in silico ) analytical methods to accurately understand RNA processing variants in our model systems, and how they are affected by oligonucleotide drugs. We expect our Senior Scientist Bioinformatics to have: Skills and competencies that are required for making the difference: As an employer, we are a true believer of the value of a workforce in which people from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to develop themselves, personally and professionally. We believe that happy and energized people, working well together in an environment in which they thrive, will do phenomenal and awesome things. We are committed to ensure that no employee, candidate, or job applicant receives less favorable treatment on the grounds of race, age, disability, pregnancy, religion, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marriage or civil partnership status. At ProQR we want to create an inclusive culture where everyone can be valued for who they are and in which individual differences and the contributions in all forms are recognized and valued. We offer an exciting and innovative working environment in a very committed organization, with the following benefits: Do you think you can contribute to achieving our mission? If so, we\u2019re looking forward to receiving your application by filling out our application form. You can contact Silvia Catellani via recruitment@proqr.com if you have any questions.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.proqr.com\/careers\/vacancies\/jobs\/4526551-senior-scientist-bioinformatics","title":"Senior Scientist Bioinformatics","sourceDomain":"proqr.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":9}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7199494866374995968","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7199494866374995968","reactionsCount":9,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7199494865900961792","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Looking for another bioinformatics colleague.
