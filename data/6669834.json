The requested revision seeks to warn of the drugs\u2019 risk of serious sexual side effects, which may persist after stopping SSRI or SNRI treatment, and may even be permanent.\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/daFXXHaj\n\nThis problem has been known for 30 years, identified quickly after the introduction of Prozac.  In the literature, it is stated that men are affected more frequently yet the side effects tend to be more severe in women.  In women, the most prevalent side effect is in the arousal domain.  \n\nMany solutions have been attempted, there have been myriad clinical trials, and there is not even a clinical guidance, never mind an approved therapy.\n\nOtrera Medical was created expressly for the purpose of developing a therapy we believe will finally help.  A topical, on-demand, no systemic toxicity medication for women who suffer from sexual dysfunction caused by an SSRI or an SNRI antidepressant therapy.  \n\nThis is possible.  We need funding to make it a reality.
