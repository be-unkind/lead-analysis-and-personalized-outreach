One endogenous substrate has recently been described (Siglec 10), and although its mechanism of action in vivo is not completely understood, it is suggested to play a role in immune cell trafficking, making it a target of interest for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Much of the enzymology performed around this target has been conducted with absorbance, fluorescent, or radiometric formats that can have some limitations for high-throughput screening and subsequent compound profiling. The authors present the use of a bioluminescen.t assay, originally developed for monoamine oxidase enzymes, in a high-throughput format. It can be used for related SSAOs such as AOC1 given their substrate similarity with VAP-1. The authors also demonstrate that it is compatible with different sources of VAP-1, both purified recombinant and VAP-1 overexpressed on live cells.","url":"http:\/\/jbx.sagepub.com\/content\/16\/9\/1106.full","name":"Bioluminescent Method for Assaying Multiple Semicarbazide Sensitive Amine Oxidase (SSAO) Family Members in Both 96 and 384 Well Formats","publisher":"Journal of Biomolecular Screening","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATjCvsBBxfMG9jXsbUWeSrAb8GsN0qTfoI,NAME_SEARCH,SdXO)"}]},{"name":"Multiple Synthetic Routes to the Mini-Protein Omomyc and Coiled-Coil Domain Truncations","publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":29,"year":2019},"publisher":"J Org.
