{"summary":"I am a professional musician as the drummer for Cheshire Grin, Dmanzland, Omega Train, and Strumberry Pie. I am also a licensed social worker in the state of New Jersey with an MSW from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, a BA in psychology from Monmouth University, and an AA in music from Brookdale Community College. My background in music, academia, research, and the working world has allowed me to exercise a diverse range of skills, such as creative thinking, a connection-driven approach to working with people, an orientation towards individual and group\/team goals, a leadership style that accounts for all voices, and a wide array of skills in research, including literature review, design, analysis, and writing. These skills come from a diverse history of experiences, including being an active musician for 14 years, coaching drums for students of all ages, involving myself in research during my undergraduate years (including conducting my own study and leading a team of research assistants in data collection), and interning and working in the world of therapy.","lastName":"M.","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:806149621","geoRegion":"Eatontown, New Jersey, United States","fullName":"Victor A.

Once the instrumentals were completed, lead vocals were recorded by three of the film's actresses and backup vocals were recorded by a children's choir of intermediate school students.

Motivated by previous work that has shown that vocal emotion recognition accuracy varies by musical ability, the current study addressed this relationship using a behavioral measure of musical ability (i.e., singing) that relies on the same effector system used for vocal prosody production. In the current study, participants completed a musical production task that involved singing four-note novel melodies. To measure pitch perception, we used a simple pitch discrimination task in which participants indicated whether a target pitch was higher or lower than a comparison pitch. We also used self-report measures to address language and musical background. We report that singing ability, but not self-reported musical experience nor pitch discrimination ability, was a unique predictor of vocal emotion recognition accuracy. These results support a relationship between processes involved in vocal production and vocal perception, and suggest that sensorimotor processing of the vocal system is recruited for processing vocal prosody.","title":"Singing Ability is Related to Emotion Recognition: Evidence for Shared Sensorimotor Processing Across Speech and
