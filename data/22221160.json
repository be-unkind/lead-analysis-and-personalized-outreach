Son is completing his Masters Research study on the overall experience and challenges of neurodivergent employees in the workplace specifically those diagnosed with ADHD. This study specifically examines the experiences from the neurodiverse employees\u2019 point of view to understand the challenges they face at work and how organisations can facilitate a neuro-inclusive workplace, reduce employment barriers and enable neurodiverse employees to reach their potential.\n\nHe is looking for volunteers to interview to share their experiences. To be involved interviewees must have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADHD), be above 18 years of age and have had at least one year of work experience. The interview will be conducted via MS Teams, and is expected to take approximately 30-60 minutes, it will be audio recorded.\n\nIf you know of anyone who can participate please contact my son (Patrick Lally) at N0922031@my.ntu.ac.uk\n\nMany Thanks"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7193518465909968896"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7193521719251222528"}}},{"createdAt":1711052220000,"insightId":"4e7c4f91-e752-4123-bbbf-242b05f2112f","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7176659982627598337,7176673288268455936)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7176659982627598337","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Fantastic result Lehaana and team.
