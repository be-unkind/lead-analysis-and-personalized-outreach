The objective of this exploratory study is to investigate the link between systemic inflammation and brain microstructural changes (measured by diffusion-weighted imaging) in patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy. 20 patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy (age: 67.3 \u00b1 10.0\u00a0years; 90% men) hospitalized in the Geneva University Hospitals for a SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020 were included in this retrospective cohort study. COVID-19 encephalopathy was diagnosed following a comprehensive neurobiological evaluation, excluding common causes of delirium, such as hypoxemic or metabolic encephalopathy. We investigated the correlation between systemic inflammation (measured by systemic C-reactive protein (CRP)) and brain microstructural changes in radiologically normal white matter (measured by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) in nine spatially widespread regions of the white matter previously associated with delirium. Systemic inflammation (CRP\u2009=\u200960.8\u2009\u00b1\u200950.0\u00a0mg\/L) was positively correlated with ADC values in the anterior corona radiata (p\u2009=\u20090.0089), genu of the corpus callosum (p\u2009=\u20090.0064) and external capsule (p\u2009=\u20090.0086) after adjusting for patients\u2019 age. No statistically significant association between CRP and ADC was found in the other six white matter regions. Our findings indicate high risk of white matter abnormalities in COVID-19 encephalopathy patients with high peripheral inflammatory markers, suggesting aggressive imaging monitoring may be warranted in these patients. Future studies should clarify a possible specificity of the spatial patterns of CRP\u2013white matter microstructure association in COVID-19 encephalopathy patients and disentangle the role of individual cytokines on brain inflammatory mechanisms.","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8552620\/","name":"C-reactive protein and white matter microstructural changes in COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy","publisher":"Journal of neural transmission","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAEAaX8sBTETObJmv3hc5gmz07E0kYrkzdrY,NAME_SEARCH,E4E7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":16,"year":2024},"description":"Acute encephalopathy (AE) has been described as a severe complication of COVID-19. Inflammation has been suggested as a pathogenic mechanism, with high-dose glucocorticoids (GC) showing a beneficial effect. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological features in a group of COVID-19 AE patients who received GC treatment (GT) and in a non-treated (NT) group.\nThirty-six patients with COVID-19 AE (mean age 72.6 [Formula: see text] 11 years; 86.11% men) were evaluated for GC treatment. Twelve patients (mean age 73.6 [Formula: see text] 4.5 years; 66.67% men) received GC, whereas 24 patients who showed signs of spontaneous remission were not treated with GC (mean age 70.1 [Formula: see text] 8.6 years; 95.83% men). Differences in clinical characteristics and correlations with imaging features were explored.\nThe GT group showed signs of vulnerability, with a longer hospitalization (p = 0.009) and AE duration (p = 0.012) and a higher hypertensive arteriopathy (HTNA) score (p = 0.022), when compared to NT group. At hospital discharge, the two groups were comparable in terms of clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale; p = 0.666) or mortality (p = 0.607). In our whole group analyses, AE severity was positively correlated with periventricular white matter hyperintensities (p = 0.011), deep enlarged perivascular spaces (p = 0.039) and HTNA score (p = 0.014).\nThis study suggests that, despite signs of radiological vulnerability and AE severity, patients treated by high-dose GC showed similar outcome at discharge, with respect to NT patients. Imaging features of cerebral small vessel disease correlated with AE severity, supporting the hypothesis that brain structural vulnerability can impact AE in COVID-19.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38363389\/","name":"High-dose glucocorticoids in COVID-19 patients with acute encephalopathy: clinical and imaging findings in a retrospective cohort study","publisher":"Journal of Neural Transmission","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAEAaX8sBTETObJmv3hc5gmz07E0kYrkzdrY,NAME_SEARCH,E4E7)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714845360000,"insightId":"37ad19d1-d43f-4539-96fc-d0ad6eca790c","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQEY0XqtwXxlIw\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1714845391539?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=72ajk0o_3ci-KHMnT5YCT6x-IkaOXPf8d5NwNpUv4sk"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":16},{"type":"PRAISE","count":3},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7192582889597739008","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192582889597739008","reactionsCount":21,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7192582888985440256","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Really enjoyed expanding my knowledge about Neurological Emergencies along colleagues from all over the world \ud83c\udf0e in the last couple days !
