SYCP3 is a component of the lateral elements of the SC. We have generated transgenic mice expressing N- or C-terminal fluorescent-tagged SYCP3 (mCherry-SYCP3 (CSYCP) and SYCP3-mCherry (SYCPC)) to study SC dynamics and chromosome movements in vivo. Neither transgene rescued meiotic aberrations in Sycp3 knockouts, but CSYCP could form short axial element-like structures in the absence of endogenous SYCP3. On the wild-type background, both fusion proteins localized to the axes of the SC together with endogenous SYCP3, albeit with delayed initiation (from pachytene) in spermatocytes. Around 40% of CSYCP and SYCPC that accumulated on the SC was rapidly exchanging with other tagged proteins, as analyzed by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. We used the CSYCP transgenic mice for further live cell analyses and observed synchronized bouquet configurations in living cysts of two or three zygotene oocyte nuclei expressing CSYCP, which presented cycles of telomere clustering and dissolution. Rapid chromosome movements were observed in both zygotene oocytes and pachytene spermatocytes, but rotational movements of the nucleus were more clear in oocytes. In diplotene spermatocytes, desynapsis was found to proceed in a discontinuous manner, whereby even brief chromosome re-association events were observed. Thus, this live imaging approach can be used to follow changes in the dynamic behavior of the nucleus and chromatin, in normal mice and different infertile mouse models.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00412-018-0668-7","name":"Live cell analyses of synaptonemal complex dynamics and chromosome movements in cultured mouse testis tubules and embryonic ovaries","publisher":"Chromosoma","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwXNkYBluuD1RwThVPlrJVneetXWpye1XM,NAME_SEARCH,dmNz)"}]},{"name":"Transition from a meiotic to a somatic-like DNA damage response during the pachytene stage in mouse meiosis","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":22,"year":2019},"publisher":"PLOS Genetics","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30668564","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwXNkYBluuD1RwThVPlrJVneetXWpye1XM,NAME_SEARCH,dmNz)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":24,"year":2019},"description":"The diagnostic performance of sequencing a gene panel based on genes associated with mouse azoospermia was relatively successful in idiopathic NOA (non-obstructive azoospermia) patients and allowed the discovery of two novel genes involved in NOA due to meiotic arrest.","url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/humrep\/advance-article\/doi\/10.1093\/humrep\/dez042\/5491329","name":"Sequencing of a 'mouse azoospermia' gene panel in azoospermic men: identification of RNF212 and STAG3 mutations as novel genetic causes of meiotic arrest.","publisher":"Human Reproduction","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwXNkYBluuD1RwThVPlrJVneetXWpye1XM,NAME_SEARCH,dmNz)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":22,"year":2019},"description":"A novel immunofluorescent approach that allows to classify testis biopsies of infertile male patients according to their type of spermatogenic arrest","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/31767154","name":"Meiotic arrest occurs most frequently at metaphase and is often incomplete in azoospermic men","publisher":"Fertility and sterility","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwXNkYBluuD1RwThVPlrJVneetXWpye1XM,NAME_SEARCH,dmNz)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":15,"year":2021},"description":"The 2021 annual ESMO meeting featured several presentations with the potential to shift the standard of care in gynaecological cancers.

In this future, hospital care will increasingly be substituted for home care in which patients will be monitored and treated 24\/7 within the comfort of their home. In this way, healthcare can be brought to the patient anywhere, at any time. The first teleconsultation took place in 1924 (Teleheath 1924) and was seen as a revolutionary way to bring healthcare to the people. Early in 2020, the number of teleconsultations increased enormously as a result of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. However, the use of teleconsultations decreased again in the second half of the year in parallel with an improvement in the pandemic situation. It has now reached a new equilibrium: there are still more teleconsultations than before the COVID-19 pandemic, but less than during its peak. Nowadays, still 62% of patients feel that teleconsultations should remain an exception.

Recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the use of a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) blood-based test showed high sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of CRC in average-risk screening populations, offering new prospects for early intervention and improved outcomes. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all cancer cases and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. 1 Early detection could prevent more than 90% of CRC-related deaths, yet more than one-third of the screening-eligible population is not up to date with screening. The detection of CRC using a blood-based test could improve screening adherence, allow its earlier detection and reduce CRC-related mortality. Building upon these insights, the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of the ctDNA LUNAR Test in an Average Patient Screening Episode) study was conducted to assess the performance of a cell-free (cf)DNA blood-based test to detect asymptomatic and early-stage CRC in a population eligible for CRC screening. 2 This study included patients aged 45 to 84 years at average risk for CRC and undergoing routine screening with colonoscopy. Standard-care screening colonoscopy was preferably performed within 60 days after enrolment. However, due to procedural delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, an extended timeline for colonoscopy was permitted. Whole-blood samples (30 to 80 ml) were collected in Streck cfDNA blood-collection tubes, processed to plasma, and stored at -80\u00b0C until the cfDNA blood-based assay (Shield, Guardant Health) was performed. The panel employed in the assay analysed cfDNA genomic alterations, aberrant methylation status, and fragmentomic patterns. The results were categorised into a binary format, either \u201cabnormal signal detected\u201d indicating a positive test, or \u201cnormal signal detected\u201d indicating a negative test. The coprimary outcomes were sensitivity for CRC and specificity for advanced neoplasia in average-risk participants, 45 to 84 years of age, as compared with the colonoscopy reference standard. 2 In total, 7,861 patients were assessed in this study. Among participants diagnosed with CRC through colonoscopy, 83.1% tested positive for cfDNA, while 16.9% tested negative, yielding a sensitivity of 83.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72.2-90.3) for detecting CRC. The sensitivity for detecting stage I, II or III CRC was 87.5% (95% CI: 75.3-94.1), while it was 13.2% (95% CI: 11.3-15.3) for advanced precancerous lesions. Among participants without any advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRC or advanced precancerous lesions) detected on colonoscopy, 89.6% tested negative for the cfDNA blood-based test, while 10.4% tested positive, resulting in a specificity for any advanced neoplasia of 89.6% (95%CI: 88.8-90.3). The specificity for negative colonoscopy (indicating no CRC, advanced precancerous lesions, or nonadvanced precancerous lesions) was 89.9% (95%CI: 89.0-90.7). 2 In conclusion, the findings from the ECLIPSE study showed promising results from the cfDNA blood-based test for the detection of CRC in average-risk screening populations. In these patients, this test exhibited 83% sensitivity for CRC, 90% specificity for advanced neoplasia, and 13% sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions. 2","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.bjmo.be\/cell-free-dna-blood-test-for-the-early-detection-of-colorectal-cancer\/","title":"Cell-free DNA blood test for the early detection of colorectal cancer - BJMO","sourceDomain":"bjmo.be"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7191825240845398018","message":{"attributes":[{"start":505,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/esKHeq_Z"}}},{"start":531,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:colorectal"}}},{"start":550,"length":7,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:cancer"}}},{"start":558,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oncology"}}}],"text":"\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25-\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc00 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\n\nEarly detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) could prevent more than 90% of CRC-related deaths.
