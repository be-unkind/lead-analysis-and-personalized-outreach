We  show  that  two  conjugates,  which  consist  of  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic payloads conjugated to two different antibodies, retain the structure and binding properties of the antibody and its biological specificity, are stable in plasma and improve anti-tumour efficacy in mice with non-small cell lung tumour xenografts. The relative simplicity of the approach may facilitate the production of ADCs for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads. \n\n","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41551-019-0470-8","name":"Computationally designed antibody\u2013drug conjugates self-assembled via affinity ligands","publisher":"Nature Biomedical Engineering","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2IhWkBWedoYEv8q-GL2lfFKIl1qW-T_28,NAME_SEARCH,h8Uc)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIPu_cB77FtFiIRFQqIPF_hgnMawm1pDu8,NAME_SEARCH,3Dvf)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQ53QQBpYthIpZae_z5nFnFDQeaVtsRMlE,NAME_SEARCH,hB60)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPsOGsBRYVmrqevXvHTD3HdGL8oOQfbkpA,NAME_SEARCH,Lawt)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADdKNABLI90mxboQNZocvD6gjnPnAfkInM,NAME_SEARCH,DEZ7)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAN482IBaY0QEv81RBLcLhbMEA9Zi4mPopU,NAME_SEARCH,wFJe)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAVxwMYBT2Ob-JGf2MSxvJ0d2H7dyMAx2L8,NAME_SEARCH,0iOT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAVpanIB57PvMClkIOGjXUXM87XkBDZ9dY4,NAME_SEARCH,GFhb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAxFePUBTmqWDvhMlYGy-sESc3-Eh-YTAYM,NAME_SEARCH,PglT)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715232060000,"insightId":"d3f82a98-c2e8-42b0-bcbf-e7412fd40e0b","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQHyTGn_Qyvk2g\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715232096994?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=iIo6e_CMxCKbKq46oOIgGMuYNHnwJhFTy-SEQvciWX8"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":48},{"type":"PRAISE","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194204851256381440","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194204851256381440","reactionsCount":56,"commentsCount":13,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194204850438451200","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services for Team Excellence Award.
