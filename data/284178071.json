In this article we describe a streamlined and practical enantioselective total synthesis of uncialamycin that is amenable to the synthesis of novel analogues and renders the natural product readily available for biological and drug development studies. Starting from hydroxy- or methoxyisatin, the synthesis features a Noyori enantioselective reduction, a Yamaguchi acetylide-pyridinium coupling, a stereoselective acetylide-aldehyde cyclization, and a newly developed annulation reaction that allows efficient coupling of a cyanophthalide and a p-methoxy semiquinone aminal to forge the anthraquinone moiety of the molecule. Overall, the developed streamlined synthesis proceeds in 22 linear steps (14 chromatographic separations) and 11% overall yield. The developed synthetic strategies and technologies were applied to the synthesis of a series of designed uncialamycin analogues equipped with suitable functional groups for conjugation to antibodies and other delivery systems. Biological evaluation of a select number of these analogues led to the identification of compounds with low picomolar potencies against certain cancer cell lines. These compounds and others like them may serve as powerful payloads for the development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) intended for personalized targeted cancer therapy","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/jacs.6b04339","name":"Streamlined Total Synthesis of Uncialamycin and Its Application to the Synthesis of Designed Analogues for Biological Investigations","publisher":"Journal of American Chemical society (DOI: 10.1021\/jacs.6b04339)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAguXCsB1MIcOJLGoaGn0kHcAaMhKCbHbg0,NAME_SEARCH,j-Fl)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABDwNpcBVvWF4RCFOiDHWyf5UbnqBAJenV4,NAME_SEARCH,gdqb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAi2BW0BpJrsMCLXvT0YHw7vKNOHVzhePWI,NAME_SEARCH,YJQV)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADc_w0BuwGVxGE5DVM5bTF76JBNtGKH0RU,NAME_SEARCH,Kg4k)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALtP9oBgmmyQR1O4wJaXa-D8qcn92lX4gA,NAME_SEARCH,s1sw)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":1,"year":2016},"description":"A streamlined total synthesis of N14-desacetoxytubulysin H (Tb1) based on a C\u2013H activation strategy and a short total synthesis of pretubulysin D (PTb-D43) are described.

When upregulated in the tumor microenvironment, CD73 has been implicated in the inhibition of immune function through overproduction of adenosine. Traditional efforts to inhibit CD73 have involved antibody therapy or the development of small molecules, the most potent of which mimic the acidic and ionizable structure of the enzyme\u2019s natural substrate, adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (AMP). Here, we report the systematic discovery of a novel class of non-nucleotide CD73 inhibitors that are more potent than all other nonphosphonate inhibitor classes reported to date. These efforts have culminated in the discovery of 4-({5-[4-fluoro-1-(2H-indazol-6-yl)-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazol-6-yl]-1H-pyrazol-1-yl}methyl)benzonitrile (73, IC50 = 12 nM) and 4-({5-[4-chloro-1-(2H-indazol-6-yl)-1H-1,2,3-benzotriazol-6-yl]-1H-pyrazol-1-yl}methyl)benzonitrile (74, IC50 = 19 nM). Cocrystallization of 74 with human CD73 demonstrates a competitive binding mode.

Amgen\u2019s Amjevita was the first of 9 biosimilar competitors that have launched in the US market. \n\nAbbVie has been preparing for Humira\u2019s LOE for years, and has a strong pipeline in immunology, including two other top 10 medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which together achieved more than $11B in sales, a ~$4B increase from 2022.\n\nSanofi\u2019s Dupixent continued to set records and recently saw a new FDA approval for pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis. \n\nIt also had positive Phase 3 trial results for COPD, which is notable given if it gets to approval, it would be the first biologic treatment approved for that condition. \n\nFinding out just how profitable a single blockbuster can be is often a challenge, but diving into Regeneron\u2019s financials sheds light on just how profitable Dupixent is: \n\nSince Sanofi and Regeneron are partners, Sanofi records revenue worldwide, while Regeneron reports only its share of profits, which is 50% on US sales, and between 35-45% on international sales. \n\nIn 2023, Regeneron recorded $3.1B in profits from its antibody collaboration with Sanofi \u2013 add on Sanofi\u2019s share of profits, and Dupixent likely generates more than ~$6B in combined profit per year. \n\nDupixent\u2019s patents run until 2031, so Sanofi and Regeneron have several years of strong growth ahead for their star franchise.\n\nOn the other hand, J&J\u2019s blockbuster Stelara will face competition in 2025, notable given the drug accounts for ~20% of J&J\u2019s pharma revenue.\n\nOne of the more exciting developments in immunology is the use of cell therapies for autoimmune conditions, particularly lupus. \n\n\nWhile there is a long way to go before commercialization, early studies have yielded impressive results, which leaves open the possibility that one day, some of the top 10 might be cell therapies."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7183854208490577921"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7184003804000841728"}}},{"createdAt":1712664420000,"insightId":"52c0df64-e0ac-4463-ac89-008e30f33d79","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":14},{"type":"INTEREST","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183435324298072064","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183435324298072064","reactionsCount":15,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183435323639574528","message":{"attributes":[{"start":139,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:330447659"}}},{"start":152,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oncologydrugs"}}}],"text":"Oncology drugs market in the global biopharma industry worth over $200B.
