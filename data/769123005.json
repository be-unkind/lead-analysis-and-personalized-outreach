We first built a general computational framework where contact-dependent cell-cell signaling networks and changes in cell-cell adhesion could be designed in a modular fashion. We then used a set of available in vitro results (that we call the \"training set\" in analogy to similar pipelines in the machine learning field) to parameterize the computational model with values for adhesion and signaling. We then show that this parameterized model can qualitatively predict experimental results from a \"testing set\" of available in vitro data that varied the genetic network in terms of adhesion combinations, initial number of cells, and even changes to the network architecture. Finally, this parameterized model is used to recommend novel network implementation for the formation of a four-layered structure that has not been reported previously. The framework that we develop here could function as a testing ground to identify the reachable space of morphologies that can be obtained by controlling contact-dependent cell-cell communications and adhesion with these molecular tools and in this cellular system. Additionally, we discuss how the model could be expanded to include other forms of communication or effectors for the computational design of the next generation of synthetic developmental trajectories.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acssynbio.0c00369","name":"Parameterized Computational Framework for the Description and Design of Genetic Circuits of Morphogenesis Based on Contact-Dependent Signaling and Changes in Cell\u2013Cell Adhesion","publisher":"ACS Synthetic Biology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":7,"year":2022},"description":"Research poster presented at the 2022 USC Bridge Undergraduate Science Program Symposium for work on developing drug-resistant piggyback vectors (BleoR) to improve induced pluripotent stem cell selection.\n\nChung, Z., Shappell, Z., Carra, D., Chung, C., & Morsut, L.

While efforts in the field have succeeded in achieving the programming of specific spatial patterns, a current frontier is the programming of tissue shape change. One of the current goals of the lab is to reach this milestone by programming tissue elongation. For that, the lab has designed a blueprint for programming elongation through the spatiotemporal control of tissue growth and viscosity. In this work, we advanced this project through two complementary approaches: 1) an in silico modeling approach to design and analyze the robustness of candidate genetic circuits and 2) a collection of in vitro experimental paradigms to develop and troubleshoot the different modules required for this strategy.\n\nIn this work, we report progress in the development of three modules required for programming synthetic elongation in vitro: proliferation control, tissue fluidity control, and spatiotemporal fate propagation control. We then used those results to parametrize an in silico model of multicellular systems previously developed by the lab in the CompuCell3D framework to simulate synthetic gene circuits and engineered cell-cell communication. Using the parametrized model, we identified better control of tissue growth rate as a priority target on which to concentrate in vitro efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated methods for parametrizing critical aspects of any multicellular tissue in silico models. We then used those methods to inform our cell engineering efforts, optimizing the efficiency of our development of a new synthetic gene regulatory network to program tissue shape change.","url":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1Cn-CxhvrMAhrq7iOIQdWQKqWZmr6Ocww\/view?usp=sharing","name":"Programming Multicellular Self-Organization of Mammalian Cells: in silico Modeling and in vitro Implementation","publisher":"University of Southern California","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":21,"year":2023},"description":"Research poster presented at the 2023 HCURA National Collegiate Undergraduate Research Conference in Boston, MA on the design of a computational program to simulate and parameterize synthetic tissue elongation.\n\nChung, C., Salazar, C., Courte, J., & Morsut, L.

METHODS: A review of research studies using the PubMed database; clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov); FDA Recall, Market Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts (FDA.gov); and emergency department (ED) visits from reports from the Drug Abuse Warning Network were conducted. A survey will be sent to undergraduate\/graduate university students through advertised QR codes and university email chains sent out to student organizations\/courses. The survey will determine the percentage of respondents who consume caffeine, the frequency in which individuals consume caffeine, and reasons for consuming caffeine. The survey also seeks to understand perceptions on energy drinks and caffeine regulation and consumption. RESULTS: From January 1st, 2000, to August 5th, 2022, 112 research studies investigated the physiological impact of energy drinks on adolescents, and 13 clinical trials from the age group of 0-17 were conducted. No FDA recalls have been observed for energy drinks or the top 4 brands within the US (by sales; Red Bull, Monster, Bang Energy, Rockstar), though some recalls regarding container manufacturing were made outside the US. ED visits from energy drinks doubled from 2007 to 2011 with 1\/10 of them resulting in hospitalization. 58% of the total ED visits were exclusively related to energy drinks. It is anticipated that survey results will indicate trends of frequent caffeine\/energy drink consumption among college students for studying, but students will not have a clear understanding of recommended caffeine intake. DISCUSSION: Due to the lack of regulations and studies surrounding energy drinks, the dangers to public health are concerning. Regulatory agencies should invest in developing new regulations regarding the content of energy drinks and monitor the marketing strategies more closely behind them.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/cts.2023.432","name":"Regulations and Marketing of Energy Drinks in the United States: A Survey of University Student Beliefs about Caffeine Consumption","publisher":"Journal of Clinical and Translational Science\/Cambridge University Press","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":8,"year":2024},"description":"(PREPRINT) This review rigorously investigates the evolving pharmacological landscape for metabolic disorders, focusing on Phenylketonuria (PKU), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Galactosemia, Medium Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD), and Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we meticulously searched databases such as NHS, Rare Diseases, Pubchem, Clinical Trials, DrugBank, PubMed, and Mayo Clinic, spanning from January 2000 to December 2023. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and potential of both FDA-approved drugs and those in clinical trials. The review revealed significant advancements in the treatment of disorders like PKU, with drugs like Kuvan facilitating improved metabolic functioning. In IBD, treatments have progressed to specifically target inflammatory pathways using drugs like Azathioprine and Mesalazine, shifting away from broader immunosuppressants. Galactosemia and MCADD, disorders without definitive cures, have shown potential in clinical trials with investigational drugs like AT-007 and Triheptanoin. Particularly intriguing are the ongoing trials for PWS, a complex syndrome, where Oral NNZ-2591 and Oxytocin demonstrate promising potential. These findings highlight the critical importance of specialized treatment strategies, tailored to address the unique metabolic challenges posed by each disorder. The diverse nature of these disorders necessitates a multifaceted approach, combining current scientific knowledge with innovative drug development. This study not only contributes to a better understanding of existing treatments but also emphasizes the need for continued research and development to uncover more effective and personalized therapeutic options for managing these varied metabolic disorders.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4228679\/v1","name":"An Analysis of Metabolic Conditions and Current Therapeutic Approaches: A Systematic Review","publisher":"Research Square","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":9,"year":2024},"description":"(PREPRINT) Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a groundbreaking advancement in cancer therapy, synergistically combine the precision of monoclonal antibodies with the potent destruction capabilities of cytotoxic drugs, signifying a new era in the targeted oncological treatments. This comprehensive paper delves into the evolving field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and their pivotal role in cancer therapy. We have conducted an in-depth exploration of the structural components of ADCs, including target antigens, monoclonal antibodies, chemical linkers, and cytotoxic payloads, each playing a crucial role in determining the efficacy and safety profile of these novel therapies. A detailed market analysis reveals the leading pharmaceutical companies shaping the ADC landscape, reflecting the growing interest and potential in this therapeutic approach. We further dissect the engineering intricacies of ADCs, focusing on their ability to target specific cancer cell antigens while minimizing off-target effects, thus offering a more focused treatment with reduced systemic side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. This approach holds promise in a heightened therapeutic index and decreased toxicity. The mechanisms and effector functions of ADCs are explored, highlight- ing their multifaceted strategy in combating cancer. We include a comprehensive look at how ADCs operate from initial blood circulation to the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. We also review several key ADCs currently in use or under investigation, offering insights into their unique mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and clinical implications. The discussion extends to drug creation modalities, focusing on innovative conjugation techniques that enhance ADC homogeneity and therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, the paper underscores the transformative potential of ADCs in the realm of cancer treatment, marking a shift towards more precise and targeted therapeutic approaches.","url":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202404.0658\/v1","name":"Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment - The Emergence and Impact of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): A Systematic Review","publisher":"Preprints.org","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":20,"year":2024},"description":"(PREPRINT) With a growing market size, and a large variety of applications, monoclonal antibody technology adoption and clinical usage is at an all-time high.

This is an investigation of drug optimization and patient outcomes when transitioning from traditional IV administrations to subcutaneous injections. The machine learning model is an extension based on a paper by Han Lou and Michael Hageman, Machine Learning Attempts for Predicting Human Subcutaneous Bioavailability of Monoclonal Antibodies, where they took 10 mAbs and analyzed 45 different features. To further extend this paper, we took an additional 10 monoclonal antibodies that were delivered subcutaneously, and took into account their dosage concentration as an extension to traditional PK properties. By including additional mAbs and dosage, a more sophisticated model can be produced with high scalability to deep learning modalities.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2024.04.14.589447","name":"Potential Opportunities of Modeling Bioavailability for Monoclonal Antibodies: An Overview of mAbs and the current challenges of mAb development","publisher":"bioRxiv","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":17,"year":2024},"description":"Research poster presented at the USC Undergraduate Symposium For Scholarly And Creative Work in Los Angeles, CA on bioengineering elongation using a computational tissue model and in vitro assays.\n\nSalazar, C., Chung, C., Courte, J., & Morsut, L. in silico Parameterization of an in vitro System for Bioengineering Towards Synthetic Self-Elongation.
