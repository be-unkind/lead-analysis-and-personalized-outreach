However, the advancements towards understanding the fundamental etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment have raised melanoma to the forefront of contemporary medicine. Indeed, the evidence of durable remissions are being heard ever more frequently in clinics around the globe. Despite having more gene mutations per cell than any other type of cancer, investigators are overcoming complex genomic landscapes, signaling pathways, and immune checkpoints by generating novel technological methods and clinical protocols with breath-taking speed. Significant progress in deciphering molecular genetics, epigenetics, kinase-driven networks, metabolomics, and immune-enhancing pathways to achieve personalized and positive outcomes has truly provided new hope for melanoma patients. However, obstacles requiring breakthroughs include understanding the influence of sunlight exposure on melanoma etiology, and overcoming all too frequently acquired drug resistance, complicating targeted therapy. Pathologists continue to have critically important roles in advancing the field, particularly in the area of transitioning from microscope-based diagnostic reports to pharmacogenomics through molecularly informed tumor boards. Although melanoma is no longer considered just \u2018one disease\u2019, pathologists will continue this rapidly progressing and exciting journey to identify tumor subtypes, to utilize tumorgraft or so-called patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and to develop companion diagnostics to keep pace with the bewildering breakthroughs occurring on a regular basis. Exactly which combination of drugs will ultimately be required to eradicate melanoma cells remains to be determined.

The prognosis for patients with MPNST is very poor. Despite TOP2A overexpression in these tumors, doxorubicin resistance is common, and the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in MPNST are poorly understood. Molecular-guided therapy prediction is an emerging strategy for treatment refractory sarcomas that involves identification of therapy response and resistance mechanisms in individual tumors. Here, we report the results from a personalized, molecular guided therapy analysis of MPNST samples.\r\nMolecular guided therapy predictions highlight substantial variability amongst human MPNST samples in expression of drug target and drug resistance pathways, as well as some similarities amongst samples, including common up-regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. In a subset of MPNSTs, high expression of ABCC1 is observed, serving as a predicted contraindication for doxorubicin and related therapeutics in these patients. These microarray-based results are confirmed with quantitative, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. The functional effect of drug efflux in MPNST-derived cells is confirmed using in vitro growth inhibition assays. Alternative therapeutics supported by the molecular-guided therapy predictions are reported and tested in MPNST-derived cells.\r\nThese results confirm the substantial molecular heterogeneity of MPNSTs and validate molecular-guided therapy predictions in vitro. The observed molecular heterogeneity in  MPNSTs influences therapy prediction. Also, mechanisms involving drug transport and DNA damage repair are primary mediators of MPNST chemotherapy resistance. Together, these findings support the utility of individualized therapy in MPNST as in other sarcomas, and provide initial proof-of concept that individualized therapy prediction can be accomplished.","url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/11\/1\/213\/abstract","name":"Molecular-guided therapy predictions reveal drug resistance phenotypes and","publisher":"Journal of Translational Medicine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFxwVEB5tO-RU3QsOzBP4Nu8z4wfPY-kkQ,NAME_SEARCH,BiBG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAxQKFYBTXx3UAvxiCSOlCKhbZnF-McX-nI,NAME_SEARCH,5Kbu)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":2,"year":2015},"description":"Background Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of solid bone cancer, with latent metastasis being a typical mode of disease progression and a major contributor to poor prognosis.

HeLa cells transfected to express the solute transporter OATP1B1 are exquisitely sensitive in vitro to microcystin LR (MCLR) and its analogs, and undergo rapid morphologic changes after exposure to MCLR. Immunoblot analyses revealed HSP27 phosphorylation increased prior to the rapid MCLR-induced morphologic changes. However, transfection of OATP1B1-expressing cells with HSP27 dominant negative mutants did not reverse MCLR toxicity. Although the MAP kinase p38 inhibitor SB202190 partially reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, the control molecule, SB202474, had similar effects. Unexpectedly, both SB202190 and SB202474 inhibited OATP1B1 uptake activity, indicating an alternative explanation for cytotoxicity reversal that did not involve p38 MAP kinase. Similarly, although the potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC) inhibitor (dihydro-indenyl)oxyalkanoic acid (DIOA), and the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) both reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, both were also found to be unexpected OATP1B1 transport inhibitors. Therefore, the mechanism of MCLR-induced cytotoxicity is obscured by the inhibition of OATP1B1 uptake activity by MAP kinase inhibitors, DIOA, and NAC.

This concept was supported by the observation that MDA231 breast cancer xenografts demonstrated growth inhibition in mice fed a thiamine-free diet.\nMETHODS:\nWe purified recombinant Bacillus thiaminolyticus thiaminase I enzyme, which digests thiamine, to study acute thiamine starvation in breast cancer.\nRESULTS:\nThiaminase I enzyme was cytotoxic in six breast cancer cell lines with IC(50)s ranging from 0.012 to 0.022 U\/ml. The growth inhibitory effects of the combination of thiaminase I with either doxorubicin or paclitaxel were also examined. Over a wide range of drug concentrations, thiaminase 1 was consistently synergistic or additive with doxorubicin and paclitaxel in MCF-7, ZR75, HS578T and T47D cell lines, with most combinations having a calculated combination index (CI) of less than 0.8, indicating synergy. Although thiaminase I exposure did not stimulate the energy-sensing signaling kinases AKT, AMPK and GSK-3beta in MCF-7, ZR75, HS578T and T47D cell lines, thiaminase I exposure did stimulate expression of the ER stress response protein GRP78.

Only three human proteins are thought to be able to mediate the hepatic uptake of microcystins (the organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP1A2), and the predominant hepatic expression of these transporters accounts for the liver-specific toxicity of microcystins. A significant obstacle in the study of microcystins as anticancer drugs is the requirement of specific transport proteins for cellular uptake. We report that OATP1B3 mRNA is up-regulated in non-small cell lung cancer tumors in comparison with normal control tissues. This finding led to the exploration of microcystins as potential anticancer agents. We have developed a HeLa cell model with functional OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 activity. Transiently transfected HeLa cells are over 1,000-fold more sensitive to microcystin LR than the vector-transfected control cells, showing that transporter expression imparts marked selectivity for microcystin cytotoxicity. In addition, microcystin analogues showed variable cytotoxicities in the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-transfected cells, including two analogues with IC(50) values <1 nmol\/L. Cytotoxicity of microcystin analogues seems to correlate to the inhibition of PP2A in these cells and induces rapid cell death as seen by chromatin condensation and cell fragmentation.

One chemotherapeutic option is the re-establishment of apoptosis. An example of such a therapy is the PKC inhibitor G\u00f66976, which activates apoptosis and shrinks in vivo tumors in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. We proposed as a mechanism blockage of activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is anti-apoptotic and often elevated in cancers. Over recent years, questions have arisen regarding the specificity of these \"small-molecule inhibitors.\" We have therefore explored the role of NF-kappaB inhibition in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using small inhibitory RNAs (siRNA). siRNAs designed against NF-kappaB protein p65 (RelA) and IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma, strongly decreased the target proteins. But, unlike G\u00f66976, they did not decrease basal NF-kappaB or cause apoptosis. In particular, the decrease in p65 protein had no effects on apoptosis or cell proliferation, thus questioning the importance of NF-kappaB alone in the maintenance of these cells. Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 caused loss of IkappaBalpha, and an increase of it is phosphorylated form, but basal NF-kappaB was unchanged, whilst activation of NF-kappaB by TNFalpha was completely inhibited, suggesting that MG-132 activity is independent of constitutive NF-kappaB activation. We ascribe these differences to the specificity of inhibition by siRNAs as compared to the well-known non-specificity of small-molecule inhibitors. We conclude that the mutations in these cancer cells made them resistant to apoptosis, by elevating their NF-kappaB and activating other basal pathways that are blocked by G\u00f66976 but not by IKK and p65 siRNAs.","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcb.20789\/abstract","name":"Targeting the NF-kB Pathway in Estrogen Receptor Negative MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells using Small Inhibitory RNAs.","publisher":"Journal of Cellular Biochemistry.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFxwVEB5tO-RU3QsOzBP4Nu8z4wfPY-kkQ,NAME_SEARCH,BiBG)"}]},{"name":"Blocking Anti-Apoptosis as a Strategy for Cancer Chemotherapy; NF-kB as a Target.","description":"Critical processes underlying cancers must be better understood to develop strategies for treatment and prevention.

The aim of the studies described here was to identify the mode of cell death induced by ZD2767P + CPG2 in comparison to the established nitrogen mustard chlorambucil. The contribution of bifunctional and monofunctional ZD2767 DNA lesions to cell death induction was investigated using a monofunctional ZD2767D analogue. Apoptosis in LoVo tumour cells was studied by three different methods (nuclear morphology, annexin V staining and TUNEL). Levels of apoptosis detected using the three assays were similar, and each drug treatment produced apoptosis at levels above those in control cells at concentrations which resulted in tumour cell growth inhibition. The bi-functional compounds, ZD2767P + CPG2 and chlorambucil, induced apoptosis in a concentration and time dependent manner, with equitoxic concentrations producing equivalent levels of apoptosis. In contrast, the mono-functional ZD2767D analogue at 100 microM resulted in the maximal level of apoptosis at 25 h with no further increase over the following 72 h. These studies have demonstrated that apoptosis is the mechanism of cell death induced by the ZD2767 ADEPT system, and that levels of apoptosis produced by ZD2767 are similar to those observed at equitoxic concentrations of the classical nitrogen mustard chlorambucil. The mono-functional ZD2767 analogue also induced apoptosis, but with a different time course and characteristics.

However, toxicity, including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, is a concern hampering its broader use.  In selecting a lead CAR-T candidate against the oncofetal antigen glypican 3 (GPC3), we compared CARs bearing a low- and high-affinity single-chain variable fragment (scFv) binding to a similar epitope and cross-reactive with murine GPC3.  Where the high-affinity CAR-T cells were toxic in vivo, the low-affinity CAR maintained cytotoxic function against antigen-positive tumor cells but did not show toxicity against normal tissues. High-affinity CAR-induced toxicity was caused by on-target, off-tumor binding, based on the observation that higher doses of the high-affinity CAR-T caused toxicity in non-tumor-bearing mice and accumulated in organs with low expression of GPC3. To explore another layer of controlling CAR-T toxicity, we developed a means to target and eliminate CAR-T cells using anti-TNF-a antibody therapy after CAR-T infusion. The antibody was shown to function by eliminating early antigen-activated, but not all, CAR-T cells, allowing a margin where the toxic response could be effectively decoupled from antitumor efficacy with only a minor loss in tumor control. By exploring additional traits of the CAR-T cells after activation, we identified a mechanism whereby we could use approved therapeutics and apply them as an exogenous kill switch that eliminated early activated CAR-T following antigen engagement in vivo.  By combining the reduced-affinity CAR with this exogenous control mechanism, we provide evidence that we can modulate and control CAR-mediated toxicity","publisher":"CYTOTHERAPY","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFxwVEB5tO-RU3QsOzBP4Nu8z4wfPY-kkQ,NAME_SEARCH,BiBG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPbIz8Bf7qVH1s-s_LBXvbGOUCklEtHwKM,NAME_SEARCH,8jSj)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEPn-8BTUm-Kf3ru_kai-G1JSoSZGfZH9g,NAME_SEARCH,L1hm)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEsAm4BXXfvMRa0nTznujJ7T0xYACC1JDw,NAME_SEARCH,C3do)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA8znZcBNOcHFV0Q79EJVPqSqynuhPMsIGo,NAME_SEARCH,hW7N)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABbUm5AB9w9-s8UFQ8l-DyTypBnT9MdkV4Q,NAME_SEARCH,-7Z0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABJ0TbEBuQBj_Lhx58OopgV9GXEwbUCNgJo,NAME_SEARCH,2DHr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGG650BXgObqzKxzaPj_Tl-6vl78GR7AFg,NAME_SEARCH,IsR7)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAArnMHYB1q8zUCkYpmeuEsEjWp4fkFckDiw,NAME_SEARCH,US-Y)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAE7-58Bu3P9QWQdbfeP3e-ZoyDptiNDDPo,NAME_SEARCH,0eJQ)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":10,"year":2022},"description":"ADC) bearing a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, alone and in combination with the poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1)-selective inhibitor AZD5305, in preclinical models.\n\nExperimental design: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and deep-learning-based image analysis algorithms were used to assess prevalence and intratumoral heterogeneity of B7-H4 expression in human tumors. Several TOP1i-ADCs, prepared with Val-Ala or Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly peptide linkers, with or without a PEG8 spacer were compared in biophysical, in vivo efficacy, and rat toxicology studies. AZD8205 mechanism of action and efficacy studies were conducted in human cancer cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.\n\nResults: Evaluation of IHC staining density on a per-cell basis revealed a range of heterogeneous B7-H4 expression across patient tumors. This informed selection of bystander-capable Val-Ala-PEG8-TOP1i payload AZ14170133 and development of AZD8205, which demonstrated improved stability, efficacy, and safety compared with other linker-payload ADCs. In a study of 26 PDX tumors, single administration of 3.5 mg\/kg AZD8205 provided a 69% overall response rate, according to modified RECIST criteria, which correlated with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) and elevated levels of B7-H4 in homologous recombination repair-proficient models. Addition of AZD5305 sensitized very low B7-H4-expressing tumors to AZD8205 treatment, independent of HRD status and in models representing clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance.\n\nConclusion: These data provide evidence for the potential utility of AZD8205 for treatment of B7-H4-expressing tumors and support the rationale for an ongoing phase 1 clinical
