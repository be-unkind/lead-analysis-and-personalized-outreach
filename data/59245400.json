{"summary":"A native of Puerto Rico, Dr. Ramirez-Fort earned her undergraduate degree at Lehigh University and medical degree at Ponce Health Sciences University. She completed a general surgery internship at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. After her surgical internship she completed multiple postdoctoral research fellowships in virology, dermatology, venereology, immunology, with her latest being in urological oncology and FOLH1 (aka PSMA) at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Ramirez-Fort then trained in radiation oncology. \n\nDr. Ramirez-Fort has authored more than 70 peer-reviewed articles, abstracts and book chapters, and has served as the lead editor for a medical textbook on human papillomavirus for Karger Publishers. She has run over 27 investigator-initiated or pharmaceutical sponsored clinical trials as sub-, co- or principal investigator.  She has gained 10 years experience in preclinical, early and late (radio)pharmaceutical and medical device development.\n\nWhile early in her career, Dr. Ramirez-Fort has already been involved in a wide range of preclinical and clinical research, including studies involving the effects electromagnetic radiation (ultraviolet and ionizing radiation wavebands) on a cellular and organismal level. Her current research interest involves the development of solutions for the current COVID-19 pandemic and developing\/optimizing dosimetry for antibody-based brachytherapy.","lastName":"Ramirez-Fort,

injury can ignite excessive fibroproliferative growth that results in keloid formation. Keloids are associated with significant morbidity related to disfigurement and\/or symptoms (e.g., pain and pruritus). First-line treatment of formed keloids involves topical or intralesional steroids. Recurrent or resistant keloids are managed by surgical excision or cryotherapy, followed by steroidal application or adjuvant irradiation. Although adjuvant irradiation appears to be most efficacious, alternative therapeutic options are needed for patients without access to radiation centers. Botulinum Toxin A (BTA) appears to have similar inhibitory effects to irradiation on the cell cycle via downregulation of pathogenic cytokines. Herein, we conducted a study to compare the efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone used alone, or in combination with BTA, in the treatment of formed keloid scars. Twenty patients with a cumulative of 40 keloids completed the study. There was no significant difference between treatment arms with respect to height vascularization, pliability, and pigmentation scores. The addition of BTA resulted in significant symptomatic improvement of pain and pruritus as compared to intralesional triamcinolone alone (p < 0.001). Irradiation is only effective when administered in the adjuvant setting where inhibitory effects on cell cycle and migration are optimized. Future studies with intralesional triamcinolone and BTA should be performed adjuvantly.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30422367\/","name":"Intralesional Triamcinolone Alone or in Combination With Botulinium Toxin A Is Ineffective for the Treatment of Formed Keloid Scar: A Double Blind Controlled Pilot Study","publisher":"Dermatol Ther","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOIA1gBqiUugTzkCNKZX_eqZmEDVTUQv3Y,NAME_SEARCH,_2vl)"}]},{"name":"The Surgical Nature of Radiation Oncology Should Be Better Reflected in Pre-Residency Training","publishedOn":{"month":9,"year":2019},"publisher":"Rep Pract Oncol Radiother","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31534441\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOIA1gBqiUugTzkCNKZX_eqZmEDVTUQv3Y,NAME_SEARCH,_2vl)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"year":2020},"description":"Lessons learned: Hyperfractionation of lutetium-177 (177 Lu)-J591 for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer did not appear to have any additional advantage over the single dose 177 Lu-J591 or fractionated two-dose 177 Lu-J591 therapy.

Each time a stone is turned in Puerto Rico, more corruption is uncovered. First, I still have the 2021 letter I wrote to the department of economic development for assistance in developing my patented methodologies and technologies related to Radiopharmaceuticals and Global BioDefense. I aimed to pioneer this industry in Puerto Rico and to generate numerous jobs for our local STEM and healthcare talent. To this day, I have yet to receive a response letter. Second, it has now been almost 2 years that I am waiting for permits to open my Guaynabo medical consultancy to the public. Why does it take so long for a medical clinic to receive permits? Lastly, since 2018 I have been appling to the university of Puerto Rico nuclear medicine residency training program. The university of Puerto Rico rejected me, just recently, from a position that I am clearly overqualified for. Why? I agree that arguing our status is not as important as fighting the corruption and restructuring the local taxation to allow the people to have the opportunity for economic development.

Should Puerto Rico become an independent nation, and a democracy were to be established, I would certainly run for President. For a democratic government to be successfully installed in Puerto Rico, we would require the full support of the United States Federal Government in a manner that would parallel the Reconstruction Era of the South, post-American Civil War. ONLY the United States could provide the protections needed and could enforce the Democratic government desired, so that we, Puerto Ricans, do not succumb to fascist rule. However, in this current political era, I believe that statehood is our optimal choice and solution to the current inequalities and poor quality of life; the choice of statehood is in the best interest of our people. Therefore, I kindly request that during these elections we focus on my candidacy for Resident Commissioner 2024, knowing that my political views are a matter of public record (e.g., Court dockets, social media posts) and believing that in Congress, I aim to argue for our equality and to strive for our statehood!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7193598693986500610"}}},{"createdAt":1714934580000,"insightId":"37580b8d-deca-4aa3-93a8-477756d3ebc3","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7192619047648120832,7192956981077266432)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192619047648120832","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Interestingly, yesterday this video had over 80 views, today it seems that YouTube decided to lower the view counts to 6 views.
