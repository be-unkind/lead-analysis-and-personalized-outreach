IMiDs exert cytotoxicity through inducing Cereblon-dependent proteasomal degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, resulting in downregulation of the oncogenic transcription factors IRF4 and MYC. To date, clinical IMiD resistance independent of CRBN or IKZF1\/3 has not been well-explored. Here, we investigated the roles of IRF4 and MYC in this context. Experimental Design: Using bone marrow aspirates from patients with IMiD na\u00efve or refractory MM, we examined IKZF1\/3 protein levels and IRF4\/MYC gene expression following ex vivo pomalidomide treatment via flow cytometry and qPCR. We also assessed ex vivo sensitivity to the MYC inhibitor, MYCi975, using flow cytometry. Results: We discovered that while pomalidomide frequently led to IKZF1\/3 degradation in MM cells, MYC gene expression was unaffected by pomalidomide in most IMiD refractory samples. We subsequently demonstrated that MYCi975 exerted strong anti-MM effects in both IMiD na\u00efve and refractory samples. Unexpectedly, we identified CD8+ T cells from patients with MM as crucial effectors of MYCi975-induced cytotoxicity in primary MM samples, and we discovered MYCi975 enhanced the cytotoxic functions of memory CD8+ T cells. We lastly observed synergy between MYCi975 and pomalidomide in IMiD refractory samples, suggesting restoring MYC downregulation can re-sensitize refractory MM to IMiDs. Conclusion: Our study supports the concept that MYC represents an Achille\u2019s heel in MM across disease states and that MYCi975 may be a promising therapeutic for patients with MM, particularly in combination with IMiDs.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/aacrjournals.org\/clincancerres\/article-abstract\/doi\/10.1158\/1078-0432.CCR-24-0256\/745321\/MYC-Inhibition-Potentiates-CD8-T-Cells-Against","title":"MYC Inhibition Potentiates CD8+ T Cells Against Multiple Myeloma and Overcomes Immunomodulatory Drug Resistance","sourceDomain":"aacrjournals.org"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":34},{"type":"PRAISE","count":9},{"type":"INTEREST","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194698710381965314","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194698710381965314","reactionsCount":46,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194698709312446466","message":{"attributes":[{"start":15,"length":19,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:606125971"}}}],"text":"Out Yesterday!

Patients with multiple myeloma may have...","fullText":"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy with debilitating complications including renal failure, immunodeficiency, anemia, lytic lesions, and fractures. Unfortunately, multiple myeloma is incurable, with most patients undergoing multiple relapses and treatment with sequential lines of therapy until they develop resistance to the standard toolbox of approved therapies. In particular, immunotherapy has changed the outlook for patients with multiple myeloma, because the approval of anti-CD38 mAbs daratumumab (Dara) and isatuximab (Isa). Typically, relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) exhibits more aggressive behavior, leading to a shortened survival for patients who have become resistant to CD38 mAbs ( 1 ). To address this, two chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel), were FDA approved from 2021 to 2022 as a new class of therapy for patients with at least four prior treatment lines ( 2, 3 ). The overall response rate for cilta-cel was 98% and 73% for ide-cel, and the median progression-free survival was 9 months for ide-cel and not yet reached at 28 months for cilta-cel ( 2, 3 ). Despite these CAR-Ts\u2019 impressive and deep responses, neither appears to be curative. Recent advances in treating RRMM have focused on bispecific T cell\u2013engaging antibodies (TCEs). TCEs are off-the-shelf antibodies that typically bind endogenous T cells using an anti-CD3 binding domain, while another domain engages a multiple myeloma\u2013specific antigen. This dual-binding creates an artificial immunologic synapse sufficient to induce T-cell degranulation and multiple myeloma cell cytolysis ( 4 ). TCEs have demonstrated success in treating RRMM, exemplified by the recent FDA-approvals of BCMAxCD3-binding TCEs teclistamab and elranatamab, and GPRC5DxCD3-binding TCE talquetamab for patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy ( 5\u20137 ). The efficacy of TCEs makes them an attractive option for late-stage disease, especially patients refractory to BCMA CAR-T multiple myeloma. However, despite impressive overall response rates to TCEs in patients with triple-class refractory multiple myeloma, responses are less common among patients who have receiving prior BCMA therapies ( 5, 7, 8 ). Therefore, treatment options with T-cell engagers targeting alternative antigens for patients\u2019 post-BCMA therapy may prove more effective in some patients. There are a growing number of TCEs in development against non-BCMA targets. One such agent, SAR442257, is a trispecific TCE that binds CD38 on multiple myeloma cells, CD3 on T cells and CD28, which is expressed on T cells and some multiple myeloma cells ( 9, 10 ). Targeting CD38 is not new in the multiple myeloma field, as CD38 mAbs Dara and Isa are commonly given in earlier lines of therapy ( 11, 12 ). SAR442257 has shown promise against multiple myeloma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo , but efficacy in primary RRMM has yet to be examined ( 10 ). As many patients with RRMM are refractory to CD38 mAbs, understanding the efficacy of SAR442257 will be critical post-anti-CD38. Some clinical studies have shown short-term success from retreatment with anti-CD38 mAbs when patients underwent a \u201cwashout\u201d period from Dara after first relapse ( 13, 14 ). An anti-CD38 TCE like SAR442257 may be more effective in the post-anti-CD38 setting, particularly in post-BCMA patients with longer washout periods from anti-CD38 mAb treatment. Here we present data detailing the activity of SAR442257 against primary multiple myeloma cells of varying treatment history using the patient's own endogenous T cells.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/aacrjournals.org\/cancerrescommun\/article\/4\/3\/757\/735113\/Ex-Vivo-Efficacy-of-SAR442257-Anti-CD38","title":"Ex Vivo Efficacy of SAR442257 Anti-CD38 Trispecific T-cell Engager in Multiple Myeloma Relapsed After Daratumumab and BCMA-targeted Therapies","sourceDomain":"aacrjournals.org"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":40},{"type":"PRAISE","count":7},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7175590020089618432","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7175590020089618432","reactionsCount":49,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7175590019292680192","message":{"attributes":[{"start":205,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:548529762"}}}],"text":"Check out our latest research: Targeting CD38 with a T cell engager is effective in multiple myeloma patient samples before and after anti-BCMA immunotherapy.
