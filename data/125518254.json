Pharmacy education and practice is continuing to evolve in the Arabic-speaking traditional Middle East countries, although relatively little information has been published in the English press. Our goal was to provide a high-level synopsis of conditions in this region.\n\nWe selected 13 countries for review. Information was obtained by reviewing the available published literature and individual university and program web sites, as well as contacting program or country representatives. Seventy-eight active pharmacy schools in 12 countries were identified. At least 14,000 students (over 75% from Egypt) are admitted into baccalaureate degree programs every year. The 5-year baccalaureate degree remains the first professional degree to practice.\n\nWhile changes in pharmacy education have been relatively rapid over the past decade, the advancement of pharmacy practice, particularly in the private sector, appears to be slower. Hospital pharmacists often possess an advanced degree and tend to have a higher level of practice compared to that of community pharmacists. Despite the adversities that face academics and practitioners alike, there is a strong desire to advance the science and practice of pharmacy in the Middle East.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2661169\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAd7Qa4BlDpEyaCeM8h-8xl9LD1IrHoodMo,NAME_SEARCH,vzCy)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJbz5sBb2CgD-j0X96j0-fEW1nAVaoYriA,NAME_SEARCH,iwjB)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"year":2012},"description":"Concomitant administration of atorvastatin, omeprazole, and dexamethasone has been shown to increase the serum concentration of serum hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A which can be associated with elevation of creatine kinase and an increased risk of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

The self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 500 physicians who were working at HMC comprising Hamad General Hospital, Women\u2019s Hospital, Rumaila Hospital, Al-Amal Hospital, Al Khor Hospital, and primary health centers. The questionnaire was composed of four parts, investigating the physicians' expectations, experiences, and perceptions of the pharmacists.\nResults: A total of 205 questionnaires were completed (response rate 41%). A total of 183 physicians (89%) expected the pharmacist to educate patients about safe and appropriate use of drugs, whereas 118 (57%) expected the pharmacist to be available for health-care team consultation during bedside rounds. The indices of physicians showing how comfortable they were with pharmacists, and their expectations of pharmacists, were 61% and 65%, respectively, whereas the index on experience of physicians with pharmacists was lower (15%).\nConclusions: Physicians were comfortable with pharmacists and had high expectations of pharmacists in performing their duties.

Despite the absence of any casual relationship between seizure and coadministration of azoles, few case reports of vincristine-induced seizure have been documented after coadministration of fluconazole or posaconazole in children. In this paper we are reporting the first young female adult who experienced generalized seizure after coadministration of posaconazole and vincristine. The 19-year-old female was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She started induction phase of Berlin Frankfurt Muenster protocol along with posaconazole 200\u2009mg three times daily as prophylactic antifungal therapy. Five days after the third vincristine dose, she developed generalized seizure accompanied by high blood pressure and SIADH. Her neurological exam\/CT scan did not show any abnormality. In conclusion, this study reports a novel finding in the sense that all previous case reports pertaining to posaconazole-vincristine-induced seizure in literature involved children. Physicians should be made aware of this rare possible outcome to closely monitor their patients and take appropriate measures to prevent such possible adverse effect.","publisher":"Case Reports in Hematology","url":"http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/crim\/hematology\/2012\/343742\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAd7Qa4BlDpEyaCeM8h-8xl9LD1IrHoodMo,NAME_SEARCH,vzCy)"}]},{"name":"Pharmacist characteristics, medication use perceptions, and professional satisfaction: a first national survey in the state of Qatar","description":"Purpose: To characterize the professional demographics, opinions about the medication use process, perceived public satisfaction with pharmacy services, and professional satisfaction of pharmacists practicing in the state of Qatar.\nMaterials and methods: The study was designed as a hypothesis-generating, online, anonymous, opinion survey of practicing pharmacists in Qatar.\nResults: Two hundred and sixty-four survey accesses were recorded during the 6-week study period, and 250 surveys containing responses to one or more questions were included in the analysis. Eighty-four percent of respondents reported graduating at least 5 years prior to the survey, and 86% held a baccalaureate degree in pharmacy as their highest degree. The most common source of the highest degree was one of five countries (Egypt, Jordan, India, Sudan, or Pakistan). Forty-five percent of respondents were working in a hospital setting, and 33% were in a community pharmacy. The lowest incidence of agreement across the 10 drug procurement and distribution process statements was observed for the adequacy of medication supplies statements (33% of all respondents). The highest incidence of agreement across the eight medication use process statements was for the statement pertaining to infrequent dispensing errors (68%), and the lowest incidence of agreement was observed for the statement pertaining to the adequacy of patient monitoring (30%). The pharmacist was chosen as the best candidate to resolve perceived unmet medication needs for four of eight statements, whereas physicians were most frequently chosen for three of the four remaining statements.

was honored to participate for the second time in the \"Optimizing Medication Safety in Primary Care & Outpatient Settings\" webinar series organized by CPD Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. My topic, \"Exploring the Roots: Analyzing Medication Errors Through Human Factors and Just Culture,\" allowed me to delve into the root causes of medication safety issues and discuss Just Culture and effective mitigation strategies.\nJoining colleagues Vyas Kattezhathu and Alla El-Awaisi, under the moderation of Dr. Anas Hamad, PhD, MSc, DMS, BSc, RPh Hamad and Phyllis Navti, was a great. We engaged in meaningful discussions aimed at enhancing patient safety in primary care and outpatient settings.\nThank you to everyone who participated and shared their valuable feedback. \n#MedicationSafety #Healthcare #PatientSafety #PrimaryCare #OutpatientCare #Pharmacy"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQEUrJxPXTG2yg\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1716210759288?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=eBHesJrVlHaXOhC3AI2ioNJQrI8ca5h_4YHAY6inH0M"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7198309651216576512","message":{"attributes":[{"length":66,"start":203,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:125518254"}}},{"length":16,"start":275,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:995493020"}}},{"length":14,"start":300,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:300394021"}}},{"length":39,"start":465,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:203186139"}}},{"length":13,"start":513,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:174921815"}}},{"length":30,"start":622,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:2632867"}}},{"length":25,"start":654,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:563045"}}},{"length":17,"start":680,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:87459911"}}},{"length":31,"start":698,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:2731261"}}},{"length":16,"start":730,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:43068"}}}],"text":"Welcome to today's webinar, the second installment of the \"Optimizing Medication Safety in Primary Care & Outpatient Settings\" series.
