potential prognostic and predictive value. This involves the discovery process from assay development, image analysis, and data mining to the final interpretation and validation of the findings. Importantly, this process is not linear but allows backward steps and optimization loops over multiple sub-processes. We provide a detailed description of the Tissue Phenomics methodology while exemplifying each step on the application of prostate cancer recurrence prediction. In particular, we automatically identified tissue-based biomarkers having significant prognostic value for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients (Gleason scores 6\u20137b) after radical prostatectomy. We found that promising phenes were related to CD8(+) and CD68(+) cells in the microenvironment of cancerous glands in combination with the local micro-vascularization. Recurrence prediction based on the selected phenes yielded accuracies up to 83% thereby clearly outperforming prediction based on the Gleason score. Moreover, we compared different machine learning algorithms to combine the most relevant phenes resulting in increased accuracies of 88% for tumor progression prediction. These findings will be of potential use for future prognostic tests for prostate cancer patients and provide a proof-of-principle of the Tissue Phenomics approach.","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-22564-7","name":"Tissue Phenomics for prognostic biomarker discovery in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer","publisher":"Scientific Reports 8, Article number: 4470 (2018) ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYBvL4Bx7ia_wQv7kx99XKR0qMq83bmH3g,NAME_SEARCH,1EHx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFV43UBEPVuN28nDTh89BWlLvUBAIqtekQ,NAME_SEARCH,tRsc)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABfW5wgBFht3TsX6OYpPpJtRs7hNCe_AIuw,NAME_SEARCH,S-uA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAACUEUMBaemAg3pOjxEgDN63-xcLRq0EQAg,NAME_SEARCH,hxNq)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGQaxQBjyr013N1n-LvV0pqwpose3mqV40,NAME_SEARCH,dRQP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABy07UBdhsOyc_mKtTYqeu1m_RCUt4jrTE,NAME_SEARCH,k9zs)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":31,"year":2018},"description":"For many decades, tumor tissue has been the basis and gold standard for cancer diagnosis and treatment, putting the pathologist close to patient care by giving essential guidance for treatment decisions. Extracting information from tissue in histopathology often is still predominantly a manual process performed by expert pathologists. This process, to a certain degree, is subjective and depends on the personal experience of each pathologist; rather qualitative than quantitative and of limited repeatability as the considerable variability in histological grading among pathologists exemplifies. Moreover, conventional histopathology currently does not allow systematic extraction of the rich information residing in tissue sections. The histological section, being a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structures, represents the complex phenotype in a solid way. The entirety of DNA, RNA, proteome, and metabolome 2are all blended into a topologically ordered and preserved morphological integrity. Therefore, the transition from a more descriptive to a strictly quantitative discipline, being the core objective of modern histopathology, is clearly worthwhile to pursue. This will allow the extraction of large amounts of tissue-derived data from many patients, enabling the creation of unprecedented knowledge through statistical evaluations and improving treatment of individual patients.","url":"https:\/\/www.taylorfrancis.com\/books\/e\/9781351134262","name":"Tissue Phenomics: Profiling Cancer Patients for Treatment Decisions","publisher":"Pan Stanford Publishing Pte Ltd; ISBN-13: 978-9814774888","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYBvL4Bx7ia_wQv7kx99XKR0qMq83bmH3g,NAME_SEARCH,1EHx)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":26,"year":2018},"description":"The level of PD-L1 expression in immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays is a key biomarker for the identification of Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer (NSCLC) patients that may respond to anti PD-1\/PD-L1 treatments. The quantification of PD-L1 expression currently includes the visual estimation by a pathologist of the percentage (tumor proportional scoring or TPS) of tumor cells showing PD-L1 staining. Known challenges like differences in positivity estimation around clinically relevant cut-offs and sub-optimal quality of samples makes visual scoring tedious and subjective, yielding a scoring variability between pathologists. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning solution that enables the first automated and objective scoring of PD-L1 expression in late stage NSCLC needle biopsies. To account for the low amount of tissue available in biopsy images and to restrict the amount of manual annotations necessary for training, we explore the use of semi-supervised approaches against standard fully supervised methods.

However, the predictive value of manual PD-L1 scoring is imperfect and alternative measures are needed. We report an automated image analysis solution to determine the predictive and prognostic values of the product of PD-L1+ cell and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) densities (CD8xPD-L1 signature) in baseline tumor biopsies.\n\nMethods\nArchival or fresh tumor biopsies were analyzed for PD-L1 and CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry. Samples were collected from 163 patients in Study 1108\/NCT01693562, a Phase 1\/2 trial to evaluate durvalumab across multiple tumor types, including NSCLC, and a separate cohort of 199 non-ICT- patients. Digital images were automatically scored for PD-L1+ and CD8+ cell densities using customized algorithms applied with Developer XD\u2122 2.7 software.\n\nResults\nFor patients who received durvalumab, median overall survival (OS) was 21.0\u2009months for CD8xPD-L1 signature-positive patients and 7.8\u2009months for signature-negative patients (p =\u20090.00002).

The status of these biomarkers is mostly scored manually by a pathologist and such scores typically, do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of the protein\u2019s expression in the tissue. Using advanced image analysis methods, marker expression can be determined quantitatively with high accuracy and reproducibility on a per-cell level. To aggregate such per-cell marker expressions on a patient level, the expression values for single cells are usually averaged for the whole tissue. However, averaging neglects the spatial heterogeneity of the marker expression in the tissue. We present two novel approaches for quantitative scoring of spatial marker expression heterogeneity. The first approach is based on a co-occurrence analysis of the marker expression in neighboring cells. The second approach accounts for the local variability of the protein\u2019s expression by tiling the tissue with a regular grid and assigning local spatial heterogeneity phenotypes per tile. We apply our novel scores to quantify the spatial expression of four different membrane markers, i.e., HER2, CMET, CD44, and EGFR in immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue sections of colorectal cancer patients.

Machine learning and particularly deep learning methods are increasingly applied in the field of digital pathology. In this study, we propose new ways to predict risk for cancer-specific death from digital images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue microarrays (TMAs). Specifically, we evaluated a cohort of 248 gastric cancer patients using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end weakly supervised scheme independent of subjective pathologist input. To account for the time-to-event characteristic of the outcome data, we developed new survival models to guide the network training. In addition to the standard H&E staining, we investigated the prognostic value of a panel of immune cell markers (CD8, CD20, CD68) and a proliferation marker (Ki67). Our CNN-derived risk scores provided additional prognostic value when compared to the gold standard prognostic tool TNM stage. The CNN-derived risk scores were also shown to be superior when systematically compared to cell density measurements or a CNN score derived from binary 5-year survival classification, which ignores time-to-event. To better understand the underlying biological mechanisms, we qualitatively investigated risk heat maps for each marker which visualised the network output. We identified patterns of biological interest that were related to low risk of cancer-specific death such as the presence of B-cell predominated clusters and Ki67 positive sub-regions and showed that the corresponding risk scores had prognostic value in multivariate Cox regression analyses (Ki67&CD20 risks: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15\u20131.89, p = 0.002; CD20&CD68 risks: HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07\u20131.67, p = 0.009).

Our data implies QCS has the potential to identify patients who may respond to AZD8205, which we will interrogate further and integrate into future clinical studies.","url":"https:\/\/aacrjournals.org\/cancerres\/article\/82\/12_Supplement\/452\/702497\/Abstract-452-Development-and-implementation-of","name":"Development and implementation of image analysis-based Quantitative Continuous Score (QCS) for B7-H4 IHC to understand AZD8205 pharmacodynamics","publisher":"Cancer Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYBvL4Bx7ia_wQv7kx99XKR0qMq83bmH3g,NAME_SEARCH,1EHx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABlfqAcBNghXoqH-8aaOh5D12Gf_eF5TZJY,NAME_SEARCH,UbMF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABggdnoBfRiytu05SCsQYcUJkE4iCfifrSw,NAME_SEARCH,K80X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABEqrj0BkvL-FprzA-PwczFzaRElnhu9Ak8,NAME_SEARCH,H_G4)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvrbA4BF_kW31IYZRyeEvz23Ze5efn9W1s,NAME_SEARCH,ihT2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYwuR4BUml6xL2Z0k4_zmbXj3wpYjY-aqo,NAME_SEARCH,7ld0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2Ly7ABmc-HqC62_aEpzNnzeuD523847kU,NAME_SEARCH,xIGH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAa-WcMBJ1qjmCU55XrUEqE3aiyEhOCWZlw,NAME_SEARCH,blzr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAS6GqABY1tC1sBQFDEHeT_csDDldsroNuc,NAME_SEARCH,7VW9)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":7,"year":2022},"description":"Results In all measured regions, we found higher densities of CD8+ and particularly PD-1\/CD8 double positive T-cells in the MHC-I high group. Moreover, we observed the highest proportion of PD-1 positivity among cytotoxic T-cells in the tumor epithelium of MHC-I high samples, which also showed a high density of PD-L1+ tumor cells. Average distance of PD-1+ T-cells to their nearest tumor cell was lowest in the MHC-I high group. In the same group, an average of 19.3% of tumor cells in the epithelium had at least one PD-1+ T-cell within a 50 \u00b5m radius, while in the MHC-I low group this average was only 8.9%.\n\nConclusions We utilized cutting-edge computational pathology to establish MHC-I as orchestrator of the composition and spatial arrangement of an inflamed SCLC TME. Beyond that, our findings corroborate the role of MHC-I as a potential biomarker for inflamed SCLC cases, which benefit most from cancer immunotherapies.","url":"https:\/\/jitc.bmj.com\/content\/10\/Suppl_2\/A168","name":"MHC class I antigen presentation is associated with an inflamed SCLC tumor microenvironment characterized by a higher density of cytotoxic T-cells in closer proximity to tumor cells","publisher":"Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYBvL4Bx7ia_wQv7kx99XKR0qMq83bmH3g,NAME_SEARCH,1EHx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-KBJ4Bcwiob-P3CyLJLGhFRwlnvpGQpEY,NAME_SEARCH,HqTW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABfW5wgBFht3TsX6OYpPpJtRs7hNCe_AIuw,NAME_SEARCH,S-uA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABy07UBdhsOyc_mKtTYqeu1m_RCUt4jrTE,NAME_SEARCH,k9zs)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAI0FN4B0eA4fIEPMhRlNmxYa8PAO1EBEZg,NAME_SEARCH,fmU9)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABtursB2PYRokBYHp2lHIj42b4Shsf6cZk,NAME_SEARCH,30t-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2Ly7ABmc-HqC62_aEpzNnzeuD523847kU,NAME_SEARCH,xIGH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAa-WcMBJ1qjmCU55XrUEqE3aiyEhOCWZlw,NAME_SEARCH,blzr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAzxI44BW2KmiJ8BM7qqV-d_AMTMCQdSD-U,NAME_SEARCH,wjcp)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB0wLWQBnmNtJrKPCTYxclHAtmyAGJV_P0A,NAME_SEARCH,1Se0)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":10,"year":2021},"description":"The novel Quantitative Continuous Scoring (QCS) provides an objective way of correlating a quantitative estimate of PD-L1 IHC expression on tumor cells with survival of durvalumab-treated NSCLC patients.
