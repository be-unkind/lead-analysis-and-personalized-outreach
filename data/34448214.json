{"summary":"Generating highly specific monoclonal antibodies targeting complex transmembrane proteins, chemical drugs, steroids, small and cyclic peptides, neoepitopes, toxins, epigenetic modifications, and carbohydrates, thanks to the unique combination of SynAbs proprietary technologies.\n\n\"Application of Synabs technologies led to the raising of therapeutic anti-CD2 Siplizumab and its licensing to our company. This successful mAb is now part of AstraZeneca pipeline\".\n\n\"For a project involving the development of innovative immunoassays againt a particular steroid, SynAbs rapidly came to the conclusion that only rat-LOU species could deliver the expected outcomes. This small molecule project has become a huge success for Immunodiagnostic Systems!\"\n\n\"We chose to launch one hard program with SynAbs in order to develop an anti-post translational modifications antibody. Indeed, there was no existing available monoclonal antibody for that given modification as of today.\u00a0We are delighted with the collaboration with Synabs!\u00a0We got a purified antibody with a high specificity to the very methyl group\u00a0!\u00a0They know what they are talking about and have considerable experience with antibody production. They are also very flexible and the communication flow is efficient as well.\u00a0 As this program is a success, VolitionRx has initiated new ones\"\u00a0\n\n\"Kinetic and functional assays with Synabs rat mAbs in comparison to the best commercial mouse mAb anti-Valproic acid reference were conducted by Werfen. All rat mAbs demonstrate a better affinity compared to mouse mAb, a dose-response curve contrary to mouse mAb.

As it may seem odd to put these two terms together, allow me to give you a short explanation.\n\nIn the case of haemorrhagic necrosis, tissue damage prevents drainage of venous blood, leading to the haemorrhage. This event interrupts adequate tissue oxygenation, further causing necrosis. A vicious circle then sets in, quickly leading to the patient's death.\n\nCarswell knew that a link had been established between Gram-negative bacteria products, endotoxins (Shear et al., 1953), and human cancer, but curiously enough he observed that endotoxins do not kill tumour cells in culture. He concluded that endotoxins were only indirect factors involved in the evolution of haemorrhagic necrosis conditions. Endotoxins were responsible for the secretion of a substance selectively toxic to tumour cells, the tumour necrosis factor. The TNF superfamily was discovered.\n\nIn 1995, Wiley et al. found a new member of the tumour necrosis factor family with the ability to induce fragmentation of Jurkat and U937 cell DNA into soluble multimers. Using Fas ligand as a positive control - which is well known to induce apoptosis - the team concluded then the discovery of a 281 aa TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and called it TRAIL.","url":"https:\/\/www.synabs.be\/2020\/10\/06\/trail-the-new-grail\/","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAINo1YBwpbGMbrdXh2CW-0RR2MmUqfh0qo,NAME_SEARCH,EqG8)"}]},{"name":"HEK293: when the virus meets the cell","publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":12,"year":2020},"description":"Since he discovered the work of the American virologist W.P.

The intensity and the direction of ion movement is based on electrochemical gradient, but also on the ease with which the ion can move through the pore, what we name the permeability of the channel for a selective ion.\n \nElectrochemical gradient is influenced by the ion concentration on each side of the membrane, but also by the electric field since ions are charged particles. Regarding the permeability, several factors play a role, but one that must be considered is the relative size of the pore and the ion: large ions are physically unable to permeate small pores.\n\nAn ion channel not only select and conduct ions, but also activate and deactivate on a millisecond time scale. Either open or closed, ion channel receptors transit from one state to another, what is called the gating phase.

Tight junctions form a belt that surrounds the cell at the apical pole and prevents extracellular fluid from passing between the cells, ensuring that the tissue is sealed.
