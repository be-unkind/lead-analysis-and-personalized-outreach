{"summary":"Gon\u00e7alo Trindade is a Junior Research Fellow at iBET. He obtained a BSc in Biochemistry from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in 2018, and the MSc in Biochemistry for Health by ITQB NOVA in 2021. The dissertation, entitled \"Pre-Clinical Evaluation of Targeted Therapies Using 3D Cell Models of Breast Cancer\" was developed in Catarina Brito's Advanced Cell Models Lab, integrated in the Animal Cell Technology Unit of iBET. The project comprised the culture of patient-derived tissue and the generation of 3D cell models in which the 3D architecture of the tumor was recapitulated by spheroids of tumor cell lines in co-culture with stromal cells. The project included the implementation of endpoint assays for the evaluation of cancer therapeutics, including novel modalities as antibody-drug conjugates. The methodology and data obtained on the culture and drug challenge of patient-derived breast cancer tissue led to the publication of a book chapter in Methods in Molecular Biology (Springer Publisher, in press) and was included in 3 posters presented in conferences, including one in which Gon\u00e7alo was the presenting author. After concluding the MSc with a grade of 18\/20 (19\/20 in the thesis), he joined the Biosystems and Data Science Group at iBET, headed by In\u00eas Isidro, PhD. He worked on a translational project aiming at discovering ovarian cancer biomarkers, using computational data analysis and machine learning for the metabolic characterization of ovarian cancer patient-derived extracellular vesicles (manuscript in preparation). He also contributed to a project on viral vector bioprocessing, exploring the effects of media supplementation in metabolism modulation and cell cycle regulation for improved AAV production. He contributed to one poster to be presented at a national conference (as presenting author). He attended several advanced courses and workshops to expand his knowledge in distinct aspects of data science and bioinformatics, including Introduction to Image Analysis, Course on Computational Systems Biology of Cancer: Multi-Omics and Machine Learning, and Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data. Gon\u00e7alo was a volunteer in several science promotion events like open days and European Researchers Night, both for students and non-scientists, and in the organization of several scientific meetings and conferences.","lastName":"Trindade","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:484584843","geoRegion":"Mafra, Lisbon, Portugal","fullName":"Gon\u00e7alo Trindade","firstName":"Gon\u00e7alo","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"iBET -
