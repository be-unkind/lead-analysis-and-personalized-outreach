This open-label, multicenter study assessed cabazitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors and normal or impaired renal function.\nMETHODS:\nCohorts A (normal renal function: creatinine clearance [CrCL] >80 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), B (moderate renal impairment: CrCL 30 to <50 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) and C (severe impairment: CrCL <30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) received cabazitaxel 25 mg\/m2 (A, B) or 20 mg\/m2 (C, could be escalated to 25 mg\/m2), once every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters and cabazitaxel unbound fraction (F U) were assessed using linear regression and mixed models. Geometric mean (GM) and GM ratios (GMRs) were determined using mean CrCL intervals (moderate and severe renal impairment: 40 and 15 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) versus a control (90 mL\/min\/1.73 m2).\nRESULTS:\nOverall, 25 patients received cabazitaxel (median cycles: 3 [range 1-20]; Cohort A: 5 [2-13]; Cohort B: 3 [1-15]; and Cohort C: 5 [1-20]), of which 24 were eligible for pharmacokinetic analysis (eight in each cohort). For moderate and severe renal impairment versus normal renal function, GMR estimates were: clearance normalized to body surface area (CL\/BSA) 0.95 (90% CI 0.80-1.13) and 0.89 (0.61-1.32); area under the curve normalized to dose (AUC\/dose) 1.06 (0.88-1.27) and 1.14 (0.76-1.71); and F U 0.99 (0.94-1.04) and 0.97 (0.87-1.09), respectively.

Altered PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway signalling is associated with aggressive PC hence we have undertaken a study vistusertib )mTORC1\/mTORC2) inhibitor prior to RP.  Methods: 1ry endpoint: measure mTOR1\/2 inhibition by IHC. 2ry endpoints: feasibility, safety, tolerability, plasma concentrations of vistusertib. Exploratory objectives included measurement of anti-cancer effects. Men, due for RP, with high volume or aggressive PC consented and received vistusertib, 50mg bd, for 15 days prior to RP. Diagnostic biopsy and RP tissue were collected for IHC. Plasma was collected to determine vistusertib concentrations. Results: 21 men, median age 62 (range 50 \u2013 69) included 11 intermediate and 10 high risk PC. 18\/21 were evaluable for primary endpoint.

The main aim of this study was to determine the recommended dose, safety, and tolerability of ADI-PEG 20, cisplatin, and pemetrexed in patients with ASS1-deficient malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods Using a 3 + 3 + 3 dose-escalation study, nine chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients (five MPM, four NSCLC) received weekly ADI-PEG 20 doses of 18 mg\/m2, 27 mg\/m2, or 36 mg\/m2, together with pemetrexed 500 mg\/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg\/m2 which were given every three weeks (maximum of six cycles). Patients achieving stable disease or better could continue ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy until disease progression or withdrawal. Adverse events were assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, and pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity were also evaluated. Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for NSCLC and by modified RECIST criteria for MPM. Results No dose-limiting toxicities were reported; nine of 38 reported adverse events (all grade 1 or 2) were related to ADI-PEG 20. Circulating arginine concentrations declined rapidly, and citrulline levels increased; both changes persisted at 18 weeks. Partial responses were observed in seven of nine patients (78%), including three with either sarcomatoid or biphasic MPM. Conclusion Target engagement with depletion of arginine was maintained throughout treatment with no dose-limiting toxicities. In this biomarker-selected group of patients with ASS1-deficient cancers, clinical activity was observed in patients with poor-prognosis tumors. Therefore, we recommend a dose for future studies of weekly ADI-PEG 20 36 mg\/m2 plus three-weekly cisplatin 75 mg\/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg\/m2.","url":"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/10.1200\/JCO.2016.71.3230","name":"Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of Pegylated Arginine Deiminase, Cisplatin, and Pemetrexed in Patients With Argininosuccinate Synthetase 1-Deficient Thoracic Cancers","publisher":"Journal of Clinical Oncology - ISSN 0732-183X","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAp42BsBrb9Db_JhRwrZWHLiGqfnILgBmOk,NAME_SEARCH,iuvH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAiTG-8BRScJkCCTF8uV_7nDL2b53OZfXtM,NAME_SEARCH,i-w0)"}]},{"name":"Adjuvant Chemotherapy for High-risk Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma","publishedOn":{"month":9,"year":2011},"publisher":"European Journal of Cancer","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0959-8049(11)72044-5","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAp42BsBrb9Db_JhRwrZWHLiGqfnILgBmOk,NAME_SEARCH,iuvH)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2017},"description":"Background\n\nPatients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer almost invariably experience disease progression whilst taking AIs.

Primary endpoint was change in tumour size (RECIST v 1.1) at 12 weeks compared to baseline.\n\nResults\n\nEnrolled patients had previously received a median of 4 (range: 1-11) systemic therapies, including endocrine treatments with a median of 2 (range: 1-6). Mean tumour size change at 12 and 28 weeks was 7% (95%CI: -4%, 17%) and 8% (95%CI: -4%, 20%), respectively. Clinical benefit assessed by partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) occurred in 36.5% (1 PR and 18 SD) and 25% (2 PR and 11 SD) of patients at 12 and 28 weeks, respectively. Median progression free survival was 3.1 months (95%CI: 2.4-5.4).Most adverse events (AEs) were G1\/2 (95.3%). 11 (21%) patients developed asymptomatic AZD4547-induced retinal pigment epithelial detachment, all resolved and 1 and 6 were able to continue on study medication at full and half dose, respectively. Among 34 G3\/4 AEs, only 6 were probably\/possibly related to AZD4547. Of 13 unrelated serious AEs, 2 were fatal.\n\nConclusion\n\nCombined AZD4547 with L or A appears to be safe and shows anti-tumour activity in advanced ER+ patients resistant to these AIs. Development of a biomarker to select patients for this therapy will facilitate future studies.","url":"http:\/\/abstracts.ncri.org.uk\/abstract\/radical-trial-a-phase-ibiia-study-to-assess-safety-and-efficacy-of-azd4547-in-combination-with-either-anastrozole-or-letrozole-in-er-breast-cancer-patients-progressing-on-these-aromatase-inhibitors\/","name":"A multi-centre, open label Phase Ib\/IIa study to assess the safety and efficacy of AZD4547 combined with either anastrozole or letrozole in ER positive breast cancer patients progressing on either AI (RADICAL)","publisher":"NCRI conference","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAp42BsBrb9Db_JhRwrZWHLiGqfnILgBmOk,NAME_SEARCH,iuvH)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"year":2015},"description":"2583\n\nBackground: The clinical utility of agents that target EGFR and VEGFR signaling in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is limited by resistance due to emergent alternative growth stimulatory pathways, particularly that of MEK. Thus, there is a strong rationale for developing a strategy to combine EGFR, VEGFR and MEK inhibitors. Methods: Patients (Pts) aged > 18y, life expectancy > 12w and cytologically proven solid tumors for which no conventional therapy exists were eligible to participate. Six dose levels have been explored. PK samples were obtained on D4, 15 and 29. Pts remained on treatment until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Results: 41 pts of median age 62y (36 \u2013 80y); M-20, F-21; lung-23, CRC-9, Mesothelioma-3, pancreas-2, Other-4 were enrolled. 40 pts were eligible for safety assessment. Median treatment time was 10 w (range 2-44 w). GI and skin toxicities were the most prevalent related AEs (GI: 124 AEs in 88% pts; Skin: 74 AEs in 95% pts). Sixteen related eye disorders were seen in 12 pts to include retinal detachments-6 (G1-2) and retinopathies-2 (G2 and 3). Evidence of dose dependent skin and eye toxicity was observed. Six DLTs were identified; Cohort (Coh) 1 - G3 hypertension, Coh 3 & 5a - G2-3 eye events (3 AEs), Coh 4 - G3 bradycardia and Coh 5b - G3 raised ALP. The PK data for V alone and in combination with S were similar to those previously reported for either drug alone. Conclusions: V and S have overlapping toxicities, yet the combination has been manageable, with the AE profile consistent with the known monotherapy profiles. A higher incidence of reversible eye events was observed in combination than with single agent S. PK has shown no drug interaction. S dose of 100mg once daily or 50mg twice daily is the MTD in combination with V. V combination MTD to be confirmed. Stable disease was confirmed in four NSCLC patients who received 6-10 cycles.

We surveyed ctDNA fragment sizes in 344 plasma samples from 200 patients with cancer using low-pass whole-genome sequencing (0.4\u00d7).

We detected enrichment of ctDNA in fragment sizes between 90 and 150 bp and developed methods for in vitro and in silico size selection of these fragments. Selecting fragments between 90 and 150 bp improved detection of tumor DNA, with more than twofold median enrichment in >95% of cases and more than fourfold enrichment in >10% of cases. Analysis of size-selected cfDNA identified clinically actionable mutations and copy number alterations that were otherwise not detected. Identification of plasma samples from patients with advanced cancer was improved by predictive models integrating fragment length and copy number analysis of cfDNA, with area under the curve (AUC) >0.99 compared to AUC <0.80 without fragmentation features.

Although the transferrin receptor is highly expressed across multiple tumor types, it has not been considered a target for antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) due to its broad expression on normal cells. CX-2029 is a masked form of a proprietary anti-CD71 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, designed to be unmasked in the tumor microenvironment by tumor-associated proteases, therefore limiting off-tumor toxicity and creating a therapeutic window for this previously undruggable target.\n\nExperimental Design: This was a dose-escalation, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of CX-2029. The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). CX-2029 was administered i.v. every 3 weeks.\n\nResults: Forty-five patients were enrolled in eight dose levels. No DLTs were reported in the dose escalation through 4 mg\/kg. At 5 mg\/kg, there were two DLTs (febrile neutropenia and pancytope- nia). Following expansion of the 4 mg\/kg dose to six patients, two additional DLTs were observed (infusion-related reaction and neu- tropenia\/anemia). Both the 4 and 5 mg\/kg doses were declared above the maximum tolerated dose. The recommended phase II dose is 3 mg\/kg. The most common dose-dependent hematologic toxicities were anemia and neutropenia.

In order to evaluate the feasibility of durvalumab treatment in HIV-patients with advanced cancer we conducted the DURVAST study, a non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial that demonstrated clinical activity with acceptable toxicity rates in this setting. Here we present the long-term clinical outcomes of the study. Methods: Study population comprised eligible patients with any solid tumor type in which anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies have approved indications. All patients had basal undetectable plasma viremia under combination antiretroviral therapy. Treatment consisted of durvalumab (1500 mg every four weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n\nResults: A total of 20 HIV-1-infected patients with advanced cancer, including 15 lung cancer patients, were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, prior findings were confirmed. At data cut off March 2020,  16 patients have died (ten due to cancer progression, while six due to non-drug related AEs), three patients have discontinued treatment due to tumor progression and one patient continues on therapy with a complete response. A median of four cycles of durvalumab has been administered (range, 1-35). Most drug-related adverse events were G 1-2 (35%) consisting mainly in diarrhea, asthenia and arthromyalgia. Two (10%) patients presented additional G3 toxicity during the extended follow-up, consisting on pancreatitis and hepatic toxicity. No drug-related deaths occurred with extended follow-up. Disease control rate continues to be 50%, without additional responses during the extended follow-up. Median duration of clinical benefit was 7.5 (range 3-29+) months.

CX-072 is an investigational PD-L1 PROBODY therapeutic that is preferentially activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME); localized activation may reduce immune-related AEs (irAEs).

Here we provide data for Mono10 and for dose escalation of CX-072 in combination with IPI (Combo), with a focus on long-term (\u22656 mo) therapy. \n\nMethods: Mono10 was evaluated in multiple tumor types. Combo doses evaluated were CX-072 0.3\u201310 mg\/kg and IPI 3\u201310 mg\/kg Q3W.

Activation of the IGF receptor results in upregulation of cyclin D1 and progression through the cell cycle. Dual inhibition of IGF and CDK 4 & 6 should lead to decreased cell proliferation through disruption of cell-cycle progression. This phase Ib trial assessed safety and preliminary efficacy of xentuzumab, an IGF-ligand neutralizing antibody, in combination with abemaciclib, a CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor. In a dose-finding cohort in patients (pts) with solid tumors, the recommended phase II dose was determined as xentuzumab 1000 mg weekly intravenously plus abemaciclib 150 mg every 12 hours (Q12h) orally. Here, we present data from an expansion cohort in pts with NSCLC. Methods: Eligible pts had stage IV NSCLC with measurable disease which had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and had either received 1-2 prior chemotherapies for advanced\/metastatic disease or were judged ineligible for further standard second-line chemotherapy. Prior CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor therapy was not permitted. Pts received xentuzumab 1000 mg weekly plus abemaciclib 150 mg Q12h until disease progression or intolerability of study medication.

The strategy of combining PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors with endocrine therapy can improve clinical outcomes (eg. BOLERO-2, BELLE-2) but at the cost of increased toxicity. Taselisib is a potent, selective, beta-isoform sparing inhibitor of PI3K designed to have a better therapeutic index than first-generation pan-PI3K inhibitors.\n\nMethods: Pts with prior exposure to endocrine therapy were enrolled using a 3+3 design, testing taselisib in combination with tamoxifen 20mg qd. A (21 day on \/ 7 day off) intermittent schedule was also compared with daily continuous dosing (28\/28). The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule. Other objectives included: pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and serial monitoring of plasma ctDNA using digital PCR \/ tagged amplicon deep-sequencing.  \n\nResults: 30 pts were enrolled in 3 cohorts: taselisib 2mg (21\/7), 4mg (21\/7) and 4mg (28\/28).

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a rational target for BC therapy, as abnormalities are commonly seen in mTOR\u2019s upstream activators\/downstream effectors in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway. We therefore performed a Phase Ib trial, combining escalating doses of the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus (T) with GC. \n\nMethods: following regulatory and ethical approvals, eligible patients with advanced malignancy were treated with one or more doses of intravenous (IV) T plus fixed doses of IV GC in a 21-day (d) cycle. Previous unpublished data suggest a possible interaction between G and T. We therefore pursued a cautious escalation strategy (see table), as a precaution against excessive toxicity.\n\nResults: 14 patients (3 BC, 2 lung, 2 ovarian, 7 other cancers; 7 previous platinum exposure) were treated, at 4 dose schedules in 2 UK centers. There were no treatment-related deaths or SUSARs. Of 14 SAEs, 4 were SARs, in 10 individuals, 7 of whom had received IMP. Addition of 10mg T on d15, then d8&15 was tolerated, but DLTs were encountered when administering three 10mg doses of T, both on d1,8&15 (neutropenia; hypokalaemia) and d2,9&15 (febrile neutropenia; rash). T was omitted because of myelosuppression on d15, cycle 1 in 6\/8 patients scheduled to receive 3 doses of T. \n\nConclusions: it has not been feasible to add three, weekly doses of T to GC, even at low T doses, in the patient group tested, because of predominantly hematological toxicity.

This variability in response can in some cases be explained by the genetic profile of the tumour.Therefore studying the relationship between the molecular profiles of individual cancers and the response to therapy over time is of crucial importance in contemporary drug development. However this endeavour is hampered by the difficulty in accessing suitable tumour material for analysis. Many patients\u2019 tumours are at anatomical sites which make biopsy difficult \/ hazardous (eg. pancreatic & lung cancers). Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be found in the plasma of cancer patients. In patients with advanced cancers, who are the primary population for clinical trials, ctDNA can comprise up to 10% or more of the circulating DNA in plasma. The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute has successfully developed a tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (TAm-Seq) method that can amplify and sequence large genomic regions from even single copies of ctDNA. This method can be highly sensitive, permitting the detection of low-level mutations, and mutations that were not originally identified in archival tumour samples whilst also interrogating many more regions of interest than traditional PCR-based assays. This approach offers the possibility of identifying actionable mutations in a readily accessible sample which represents the current state of a patient\u2019s disease. It also offers the possibility of early identification of resistance mutations to targeted treatments and\/or detection of disease progression.\n\nObjectives:To explore potential:\n- predictive biomarkers (trial enrichment, better response rates)\n- early response biomarkers (stop ineffective treatments earlier)\n- mechanisms of drug resistance (eg. rising titres of \u201cdriver\u201d gene mutations)","publisher":"Cambridge Cancer Centre Symposium - University of Cambridge","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAp42BsBrb9Db_JhRwrZWHLiGqfnILgBmOk,NAME_SEARCH,iuvH)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":2,"year":2014},"description":"Abstract\nBackground: S-222611 is a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HER4 with preclinical activity in models expressing these proteins.

Hoy, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, le queda solo un mes de tratamiento y, gracias a que su onc\u00f3loga la anim\u00f3 a unirse al programa \u2018 Mueve Monta\u00f1as \u2019, comenz\u00f3 a hacer ejercicio y ahora \u00ab ya puedo levantar el brazo como cualquier otra persona \u00bb, afirma con orgullo la malague\u00f1a. Pero no solo ha recuperado la movilidad de su brazo completamente, sino que tambi\u00e9n tiene menos dolores en las articulaciones, es capaz de levantarse de una silla sin problema e incluso puede hacer \u00abun mont\u00f3n\u00bb de sentadillas . Una haza\u00f1a que hace un a\u00f1o le parec\u00eda imposible de realizar. \u00ab El programa es fant\u00e1stico de verdad, ojal\u00e1 durase m\u00e1s porque ayuda mucho \u00bb, insiste Marta, que asegura que solo puede tener \u00abpalabras buenas\u00bb para describirlo. Y no es la \u00fanica. Isidra S\u00e1nchez (53 a\u00f1os) sostiene con firmeza que unirse al programa \u2018 Mueve Monta\u00f1as\u2019 ha marcado un antes y un despu\u00e9s en su vida. \u00abPara m\u00ed ha supuesto un punto de inflexi\u00f3n en el sentido de que he incorporado a mi rutina el ejercicio , sobre todo, de fuerza . Y el hecho de tener que ir dos d\u00edas a la semana por las tardes me ha ayudado a organizarme y coger el h\u00e1bito \u00bb, explica Isidra, que, en su caso, lleg\u00f3 a \u2018Mueve Monta\u00f1as\u2019 gracias a que se lo recomendaron algunas compa\u00f1eras de la asociaci\u00f3n de la que forma parte, ASAMMA . \u00abLlevaba mucho tiempo buscando algo as\u00ed, porque yo tengo obesidad y el ejercicio era mi punto d\u00e9bil porque soy bastante perezosa \u00bb, confiesa Isidra, que desde que se uni\u00f3 al programa ha perdido m\u00e1s de diez kilos y ha logrado que desaparezcan gran parte de los dolores que sufr\u00eda. Para ella, ha sido como \u00abun trampol\u00edn\u00bb y el impulso que necesitaba para apuntarse a un entrenador personal y comenzar a llevar una dieta adecuada. \u00abAlgo importante para m\u00ed fue el hecho de tomar conciencia de que ten\u00eda que hacer algo. Antes de empezar me hab\u00edan detectado una prediabetes y, adem\u00e1s, ya tengo una edad, lo que sumado al c\u00e1ncer , que el tratamiento limita mucho, pens\u00e9 que era el momento de empezar a cuidarse bien porque, si no es ahora, luego va a ser m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil\u00bb, reflexiona Isidra, a la que le diagnosticaron un c\u00e1ncer de mama HER2 reci\u00e9n cumplidos los 46 a\u00f1os, tras detectarse ella misma un bulto. \u2018Mueve Monta\u00f1as \u2019 es un programa de la Unidad de Gesti\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica Intercentros (UGCI) del servicio de Oncolog\u00eda M\u00e9dica de M\u00e1laga que engloba ejercicio f\u00edsico, talleres de alimentaci\u00f3n y h\u00e1bitos de vida saludable, y grupos de apoyo emocional para mujeres que han superado un c\u00e1ncer de mama. Tres pilares que buscan dotar a las pacientes, a lo largo de los tres meses que dura el proyecto , de las herramientas y pautas necesarias para introducir cambios en su rutina y llevar una vida m\u00e1s saludable que las proteja de posibles reca\u00eddas. \u00abEl ejercicio f\u00edsico es un arma muy valiosa en la prevenci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer . Es capaz de prevenir hasta once tipos de c\u00e1ncer en las personas que realizan ejercicios f\u00edsicos de manera regular. Y, sobre todo, parece que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 influyendo en mejorar el pron\u00f3stico , es decir, todo apunta a que en los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer, sobre todo de c\u00e1ncer de mama, colon o pr\u00f3stata , que realizan ejercicios f\u00edsicos despu\u00e9s del diagn\u00f3stico va a disminuir sus riesgos de reca\u00eddas, es decir, va a aumentar su supervivencia\u00bb, explica la doctora Bella Pajares , coordinadora del programa que ide\u00f3 junto a su jefe, el doctor Emilio Alba , al tomar conciencia de los beneficios que el ejercicio ten\u00eda, tanto para la prevenci\u00f3n, como para la mejora del pron\u00f3stico de los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer y de los efectos secundarios. \u00ab Sabemos que es un arma terap\u00e9utica no farmacol\u00f3gica , es decir, no es un medicamento, por lo que no tiene efectos secundarios y los efectos que tiene son positivos, no solo con respecto al c\u00e1ncer, los tratamientos y las, toxicidades , sino tambi\u00e9n a nivel global, emocional , cardiovascular y del sistema inmunitario \u00bb, insiste la doctora, que resalta la capacidad del ejercicio f\u00edsico de mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes, al aliviar la fatiga asociada al tratamiento, mejorar su funcionalidad y disminuir los niveles de estr\u00e9s y ansiedad. Para introducir a las pacientes en el deporte, cuentan con una fisioterapeuta , Inmaculada Conejo , especializada en ejercicio f\u00edsico con pacientes con c\u00e1ncer, que no solo supervisa y ense\u00f1a a las mujeres a realizar los ejercicios correctamente, sino que tambi\u00e9n les ayuda a perder el miedo al ejercicio , derrumbando mitos como que no pueden usar el brazo o levantar peso. Tanto los ejercicios como los talleres se llevan a cabo en el Centro de Especialidades San Jos\u00e9 Obrero (Barbarela) dos veces por semanas en grupos de diez mujeres. Para comprobar la evoluci\u00f3n de las pacientes, se les mide una serie de variables, como el peso, \u00edndice de masa muscular, adherencia a la dieta mediterr\u00e1nea, la capacidad de hacer actividades diarias, niveles de colesterol, estado de la flora intestinal, etc., tanto al inicio del programa como al final, para poder comprobar la progresi\u00f3n. \u00abEn las anal\u00edticas comprobamos c\u00f3mo mejoran en casi todo. Y, por ejemplo, la que al principio daba dos vueltas y se asfixiaba, al acabar el programa es capaz de dar tres o cuatro vueltas al circuito\u00bb, apunta la onc\u00f3loga. Para lograr esa mejor\u00eda, adem\u00e1s del deporte , es fundamental cuidar la alimentaci\u00f3n y por ello el programa tambi\u00e9n ofrece talleres sobre c\u00f3mo recuperar la dieta mediterr\u00e1nea , que, como destaca la doctora Pajares \u00abes la que tiene mayor evidencia de asociarse a un menor riesgo de desarrollo de c\u00e1ncer\u00bb. Tambi\u00e9n aprenden a c\u00f3mo organizar de manera sencilla un men\u00fa semanal, cu\u00e1les son los diferentes grupos nutricionales, a leer las etiquetas de los productos... \u00abLas charlas nutricionales son estupendas y, al final, una vez te haces con la copla no es tan dif\u00edcil , porque igual de r\u00e1pido es prepararte un tomate picado con queso que calentarte una pizza \u00bb, reconoce Isidra. Por su parte, Marta asegura que ha aprendido \u00abmuch\u00edsimo\u00bb y que, aunque a\u00fan le quedan aspectos que mejorar, ya ha empezado a modificar su dieta. \u00abYo siempre hab\u00eda asociado la alimentaci\u00f3n a un tema de peso y, como siempre he estado delgada, no le daba importancia. Pero hay que saber que est\u00e1 afectando a tu organismo, aunque t\u00fa est\u00e9s delgado \u00bb, reflexiona la malague\u00f1a. \u00abDespu\u00e9s del diagn\u00f3stico tambi\u00e9n hay muchos estudios que nos hablan que una dieta baja en az\u00facares refinados , grasas saturadas y ricas en frutas , en verdura , cereales integrales , tambi\u00e9n va a tener un papel protector\u00bb, explica la onc\u00f3loga, que puntualiza que el programa no solo se centra en la alimentaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n en h\u00e1bitos de vida saludables como los perjuicios del tabaco , el alcohol , el estr\u00e9s o la importancia del sue\u00f1o nocturno, que tambi\u00e9n van a influir en el estado inmunol\u00f3gico y las defensas del paciente. Por \u00faltimo, el tercer pilar clave del programa son los grupos de apoyo emocional, dirigidos por terapeutas especializados en pacientes oncol\u00f3gicos, en los que se fomentan que las pacientes se conozcan, creen una serie de v\u00ednculos y puedan compartir los temas que les preocupan como el miedo a las reca\u00eddas, el pensamiento anticipatorio, el estr\u00e9s, la imagen corporal o el tema de la sexualidad. \u00ab Nos parec\u00eda muy importante que pacientes que han pasado por un mismo proceso pudiesen compartir todas esas experiencias y dotarlas de las herramientas necesarias para afrontar mejor el proceso de c\u00e1ncer\u00bb, explica la doctora Pajares, que subraya que uno de los temas fundamentales que se trata es el tema del autocuidado. \u00ab Muchas pacientes son mujeres j\u00f3venes que est\u00e1n en edad de crianza y dedicadas al cuidado de su familia y entorno, por lo que les cuesta mucho pensar en su propia necesidad y centrarse en ellas durante esta etapa del proceso oncol\u00f3gico. Entonces el tema del autocuidado y de la autocompasi\u00f3n es algo que se trabaja mucho\u00bb, apunta la onc\u00f3loga. \u00abLa verdad es que ayuda mucho. Hablas , te desahogas y ves que no est\u00e1s t\u00fa sola . Evidentemente, s\u00e9 que hay m\u00e1s gente que est\u00e1 en unas circunstancias similares, pero no es lo mismo saberlo que verlo y conocerlas. Adem\u00e1s es un grupo muy apa\u00f1ado, son todas estupendas\u00bb, comparte Marta, que se\u00f1ala que mantienen el grupo de WhatsApp juntas y quedan de vez en cuando para comer , merendar o pasear .
