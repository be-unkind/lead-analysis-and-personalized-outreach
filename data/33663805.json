{"summary":"I have 10+ years of experience in emergency medicine pharmacy, toxicology and pharmacy management. Currently, I work as a Director of Clinical Value at Bluesight, a digital health startup where one of my  focuses is on controlled substance diversion management. I work with pharmacists and nursing staff across the country to learn about and create controlled substance diversion management best practices.\n\nDuring my time as a bedside pharmacist, I created emergency medicine pharmacy services a MacNeal Hospital. Some of my greatest accomplishments involved being a champion of opioid stewardship and creating a task force at MacNeal Hospital to develop a take-home naloxone program. Later in my management role, I had experience in leading large teams and being a leader in several technology launches (EMR, AWS, ADC, KitCheck and IV Pumps.)\n\nI am available for consulting work regarding pharmacist standards of care, toxicology and drug information. Feel free to send a message to contact me for any opportunities in this space. \n\nOutside of work you can find me cooking, traveling or enjoying my Peloton!","lastName":"Splawski PharmD MS BCPS","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:33663805","geoRegion":"Chicago, Illinois, United States","fullName":"Jennifer Splawski PharmD MS BCPS","firstName":"Jennifer","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Bluesight","title":"Director of Clinical Value","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":3},"companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"51-200","headquarters":{"geographicArea":"Virginia","country":"United States","city":"Alexandria","postalCode":"22314","line1":"1800 Duke St"},"website":"https:\/\/bluesight.com\/","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/bluesight-inc\/","industry":"Software Development"},"startedOn":{"month":1,"year":2024},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:2367428"}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIBqz0BU3PvCo6aFiF7f2Sguz8lCgBpk0A,NAME_SEARCH,WUxR)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1663361080212?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=aih_-NSb7HtdPQbR3emDl20OBDygZaBj9dcUiTrW69o","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1663361080212?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=Br1tbn0KzTAnKg8IuSBx9fZ3YOoMfnQKom2WOhsx3sw","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1663361080212?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=G3sfV7CBuX1gkQ3jbPjpMK5JU2QqQeFKSUD_5C1Aq-g","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1663361080212?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=JIu1WR1QPPY025mjzXkO6UcrPKdv7GC9t1bmrOi7N3k","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5603AQENSN_UeND3vg\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Hospitals and Health Care","educations":[{"degree":"Pharm.
