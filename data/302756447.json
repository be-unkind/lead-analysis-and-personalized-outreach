Critical evaluation of bioactive-food matrix interactions and determining the extent of synergies between the 3 bioactives are key elements of PATHWAY-27. The project will also consider the technological modifications occurring during food processing and production, as well as the frequency of consumption and the consumers' acceptance of the BEF.\n\nThe multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled project will determine the impact of BEF on physiologically-relevant endpoints of the Metabolic Syndrome (MS), a risk factor for many diseases, performing three pilot studies and one larger intervention trial. Parallel in vitro\/in vivo studies will enable selection of robust biomarkers by advanced omics techniques, and will deliver a better understanding of the role and mechanisms of action of the 3 bioactives and BEF.\n\nThe project will also include generic protocols, best practices and guidelines for planning dietary interventions, and guidance to SMEs for producing health-promoting BEF and for submitting convincing health claim dossiers to EFSA. PATHWAY guidelines will be generic and will apply to a wide range of bioactives and BEF. The project impact will be optimised across Europe by targeted dissemination to industry (especially SME), consumer and Science & Technology stakeholders.

As pleasure is an integral part of an adequate diet, the first objective is to identify the requirements and expectations of seniors. These data will then be translated into guidelines to help us conceive, elaborate and test tastier, attractive foods with easy-to-eat textures and of course nutritional interests. The research will focus on vegetables and fruits as they offer a large variety of tastes, colours and textures, and as emerging literature connects higher intake of vegetables and fruits to improved health outcomes, including mortality, disability, chronic diseases and other geriatric conditions. Other factors such as food safety, adapted packaging and environmental costs assessment will also be investigated.\nWe will strive to provide the results, on the one hand, providing practical and appropriate tools to the general public, and secondly, by disseminating information to the scientific community throughout the project.","title":"Optimised food products for elderly populations (OPITFEL EU)","url":"http:\/\/www.optifel.eu","members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABILsl8BzesGWE6XKmeOYBNEiHQPNUxYo4s,NAME_SEARCH,aIfx)"}],"startedOn":{"month":4,"year":2016}},{"endedOn":{"month":8,"year":2015},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABILsl8BzesGWE6XKmeOYBNEiHQPNUxYo4s,NAME_SEARCH,aIfx)"}],"description":"The study investigated the effect Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) had on ventilatory measures. The study aimed to contribute to the current plethora of research and distinguish if a significant and meaningful difference was found in two varying protocols, after 5 weeks of IMT. A prospective, controlled, double-blind design was employed as twenty-eight healthy and recreationally active males, were randomly allocated to one of three groups. Two training groups, either 30 (L-IMT) or 50% (H-IMT) of relative Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and a control group was tested at 3 points of time (preliminary, post 2 weeks IMT and post 5 weeks IMT). Ventilatory function was measured using several spirometry variables. Findings showed MIP increased significantly (p<0.01) in all three groups after 5 weeks, however more so in the H-IMT (107.7 \u00b1 29.2 \u2013 165.1 \u00b1 26.2 cmH20) compared to 108.31 \u00b1 22.9 \u2013 145.4 \u00b1 26.6 cmH20 in the L-IMT and 104.24 \u00b1 11.9 to119.9 \u00b1 30.5 cmH20 in the control. Although there was no significant difference between H-IMT and L-IMT for MIP, H-IMT improved noticeably more 41% appose to 28.6%. There was no significant change of ventilatory function following H-IMT or L-IMT, proposing volitional tests alone may not be adequate evidence to underpin the mechanisms of IMT in a small sample of healthy males. To conclude, IMT at a higher intensity was more likely to increase MIP than training at a lowered intensity for an identical duration, therefore providing a more time efficient training programme in this cohort.","title":"Dissertation - Investigating the Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training Intensity on Ventilatory Function in Physically Active Males","startedOn":{"month":5,"year":2015}},{"endedOn":{"month":8,"year":2015},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABILsl8BzesGWE6XKmeOYBNEiHQPNUxYo4s,NAME_SEARCH,aIfx)"}],"title":"The Effect of Normobaric Hypoxia on Substrate Oxidation, Appetite and Energy Intake.","startedOn":{"month":5,"year":2015}},{"endedOn":{"year":2015},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABILsl8BzesGWE6XKmeOYBNEiHQPNUxYo4s,NAME_SEARCH,aIfx)"}],"description":"Participated in the PhD study to see the effect beetroot consumption had upon 1500m time trial performance at simulated altitude.
