the identification of individual cardiac cycles. However, objective comparisons of these proposed methods are lacking. This paper, therefore, conducts a systematic and objective performance evaluation and comparison of several of these approaches. Five peak-detection methods (three replicated from the literature and two adapted from code provided by the methods' authors) are compared using data from 30 volunteers. A basic cross-correlation approach was also included as a sixth method. Two high-performing methods were identified: the method proposed by Sadek et al. and the method proposed by Br\u00fcser et al. The first achieved the highest average peak-detection rate of 94%, the lowest average false alarm rate of 0.0552 false alarms per second, and a relatively small mean absolute error between the real and detected peaks: 0.0175 seconds. The second method achieved the lowest mean absolute error of 0.0088 seconds between the real and detected peaks, an average peak-detection success rate of 89%, and 0.0766 false alarms per second. All metrics are averaged across participants.","url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/8695012\/","name":"Performance comparison for ballistocardiogram peak detection methods","publisher":"IEEE Access","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABf7xIwBJjgWiMb7La0ljr8RpuafKdm3MNE,NAME_SEARCH,P8BO)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA65i0UBFCjmHPiDIvrXYDX3Vv0vkIQ-njk,NAME_SEARCH,P-NV)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":18,"year":2018},"description":"Several methods are proposed in the literature to detect ballistocardiogram (BCG) peaks.
