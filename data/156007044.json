{"summary":"Engineer with a flair for system design, and development, especially for novel applications in Bio\/medical devices, integrating complex hardware and software. \n\nCurrently working as a test software engineer at a leading hearing aid manufacturer.\n\nI have experience in brain-computer interface system development based on MATLAB object-oriented programming, combined with machine learning. I also have the knowledge and hands-on experience fabricating Organ-on-Chip during my master thesis project. In my PhD, I developed a novel nanoscale 3D printing system based on electron beam processing, to manufacture next-gen brain implants.","lastName":"Kaysa","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:156007044","geoRegion":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","fullName":"Affan Kaysa","firstName":"Affan","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Demant","description":"Test software engineer in Core Technology Development (CTD) team.","title":"Software Engineer","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"10001+","headquarters":{"country":"Denmark","city":"Sm\u00f8rum","postalCode":"2765","line1":"Kongebakken 9"},"website":"http:\/\/www.demant.com","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/demant\/","industry":"Medical Equipment Manufacturing"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:1570328","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1,"numMonths":3},"startedOn":{"month":3,"year":2023}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlMeoQBSy3swyrX9EZVN3fwk54TyNoDsaA,NAME_SEARCH,BJhD)","projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":4,"year":2014},"description":"A prototype of electrical wheelchair that can be operated with Brain Computer Interface system.
