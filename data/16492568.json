We have completed a phase I study in which patients with multiple myeloma (MM) underwent serial vaccination with the DC\/MM fusions in conjunction with GM-CSF. DCs were generated from adherent mononuclear cells cultured with GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF\u03b1 and fused with myeloma cells obtained from marrow aspirates. Vaccine generation was successful in 17\/18 patients. Successive cohorts were treated with 1x106, 2x106, and 4x106 fusion cells, respectively, with 10 patients treated at the highest dose level. Vaccination was well tolerated without evidence of dose limiting toxicity. Vaccination resulted in the expansion of circulating CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes reactive with autologous myeloma cells in 11\/15 evaluable patients. Humoral responses were documented by SEREX analysis. A majority of patients with advanced disease demonstrated disease stabilization with 3 patients showing ongoing stable disease at 12, 25, and 41 months, respectively. Vaccination with DC\/MM fusions was feasible, well tolerated and resulted in anti-tumor immune responses and disease stabilization in a majority of patients.\n","publisher":"Blood","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAD7qBgB-X-HneSfKuDyRi7hHLmVr-pfW_8,NAME_SEARCH,hTyV)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXgp7QBf3798r_fiJvoki_zvDYolLNfV5o,NAME_SEARCH,6Ilu)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANQ4V0B2GDPKSOXPvPIL5nwizKk94F6xS0,NAME_SEARCH,L0Mq)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmNOrMBtt0KvSmFngAj1XlD3gbVAvUIA4U,NAME_SEARCH,fR_T)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"year":2007},"description":"Defining the immune correlates of the protection against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition in individuals who are exposed to HIV-1 but do not become infected may provide important direction for the creation of an HIV-1 vaccine. We have employed the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)\/rhesus monkey model to determine whether monkeys can be repeatedly exposed to a primate lentivirus by a mucosal route and escape infection and whether virus-specific immune correlates of protection from infection can be identified in uninfected monkeys. Five of 18 rhesus monkeys exposed 18 times by intrarectal inoculation to SIVmac251 or SIVsmE660 were resistant to infection, indicating that the exposed\/uninfected phenotype can be reproduced in a nonhuman primate AIDS model. However, routine peripheral blood lymphocyte gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), tetramer, and intracellular cytokine staining assays, as well as cytokine-augmented ELISPOT and peptide-stimulated tetramer assays, failed to define a systemic antigen-specific cellular immune correlate to this protection. Further, local cell-mediated immunity could not be demonstrated by tetramer assays of these protected monkeys, and local humoral immunity was not associated with protection against acquisition of virus in another cohort of mucosally exposed monkeys. Therefore, resistance to mucosal infection in these monkeys may not be mediated by adaptive virus-specific immune mechanisms. Rather, innate immune mechanisms or an intact epithelial barrier may be responsible for protection against mucosal infection in this population of monkeys.

Additionally, native Tat vaccines have conferred strong protection against simian\/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV89.6P challenge of cynomolgus monkeys, while native, inactivated, or vectored Tat vaccines have failed to elicit similar protective efficacy in rhesus macaques. Here we asked if priming rhesus macaques with replicating Ad-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat and boosting with the Tat protein would elicit protection against SHIV89.6P. We also evaluated a Tat\/Env regimen, adding an Ad-HIV env recombinant and envelope protein boost to test whether envelope antibodies would augment acute-phase protection. Further, expecting cellular immunity to enhance chronic viremia control, we tested a multigenic group: Ad-HIV tat, -HIV env, -SIV gag, and -SIV nef recombinants and Tat, Env, and Nef proteins. All regimens were immunogenic. A hierarchy was observed in enzyme-linked immunospot responses (with the strongest response for Env, followed by Gag, followed by Nef, followed by Tat) and antibody titers (with the highest titer for Env, followed by Tat, followed by Nef, followed by Gag). Following intravenous SHIV89.6P challenge, all macaques became infected. Compared to controls, no protection was seen in the Tat-only group, confirming previous reports for rhesus macaques. ...","url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/81\/7\/3414.long","name":"A replication-competent adenovirus-HIV tat and Ad-HIV env priming\/Tat and envelope protein boosting regimen elicits enhanced protective efficacy against simian\/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV89.6P challenge in rhesus macaques.","publisher":"Journal of Virology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAD7qBgB-X-HneSfKuDyRi7hHLmVr-pfW_8,NAME_SEARCH,hTyV)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOmQnkBT-kjIKHeQbBHskr5dFs16eCnRsY,NAME_SEARCH,woH6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAACzFvcB18o2lYq7rR5dw0JCpJMcez1dAng,NAME_SEARCH,OGJd)"}]},{"name":"Treatment of Epstein-Barr-virus-positive post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease with partially HLA matched allogeneic cytotoxic T cells","publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":10,"year":2002},"description":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a common, often fatal, complication of bone-marrow and solidorgan transplantation.
