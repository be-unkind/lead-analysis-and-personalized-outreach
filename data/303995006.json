Pleurotus is a genus of gilled mushrooms which includes one of the most widely eaten mushrooms, P.ostreatus. Species of Pleurotus may be called oyster, abalone, or tree mushrooms, and are some of the most commonly cultivated edible mushrooms in the world. The different types of media widely used are hay, saw dust, coconut husk etc .which are organic wastes rich in cellulose content. However the huge amounts of residual plant biomass considered as \u201cwaste\u201d can potentially be converted into various media for mushroom culture. The objective of the present study is to bring forth the complete economic value of mushroom culture using the best suitable media. Along with this, value is added to the media which can be used as compost after the cultivation of the mushroom.  Edible mushrooms are consumed by humans as comestibles for their nutritional value and they are occasionally consumed for their supposed medicinal value. The mycelia completed colonization, primordium initiation and fruiting body formation were found within 28, 40 and 44 days, respectively.  When the percentage of biological efficiency was taking into account the lignocellulosic substrate like mixture of hay, coconut husk and saw dust has shown great potential for use as a raw material instead of other media since this substrate provides an economically acceptable production alternative for P. ostreatus cultivation.","title":"Effective utilization of Ligno cellulosic waste by Mushroom culture","startedOn":{"month":7,"year":2013}},{"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABIemH4BcYHFWsBZ-OYmGNCCJvY9yt13xe0,NAME_SEARCH,BZwQ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABfuqmMBGCef3W_cewnULFARiK7ELCZFLhU,NAME_SEARCH,9rKy)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABSsNA8Bnxxfxo1NeMkzLo7pJfEcVqFODM4,NAME_SEARCH,vkMp)"}],"description":"Silver nanoparticles are nanoparticles of silver which are in the range of 1 and 100 nm in size. The unique properties of silver nanoparticles make them ideal for numerous technologies, including biomedical, materials,optical, and antimicrobial applications .The major methods used for silver nanoparticle synthesis are the physical and chemical methods. The problem with the chemical and physical methods is that the synthesis is expensive and can also have toxic substances absorbed onto them. To overcome this, the biological method provides a feasible alternative. In most of the therapeutic applications, it is the antimicrobial property that is being majorly explored, though the anti-inflammatory property has its fair share of applications.This project provides a comprehensive view on the mechanism of action, production, applications in the medical field, and the health and environmental concerns that are allegedly caused due to these nanoparticles.The focus is on effective and efficient synthesis of silver nanoparticles through a biological approach .The project mainly deals with the production of silver nanoparticles using bacterial strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and also utilising plant extracts of  Murraya koenigii  leaf ( curry leaf)   and  Bamboo Leaves Extracts to produce these Ag-NP from Silver Nitrate [Ag(NO)3].","title":"Silver nano particle synthesis: a biological approach","startedOn":{"month":10,"year":2014}},{"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABIemH4BcYHFWsBZ-OYmGNCCJvY9yt13xe0,NAME_SEARCH,BZwQ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhLGGgBk-gNCDh91ivkipI1-PRolEzm5Tw,NAME_SEARCH,Mdpb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABfuqmMBGCef3W_cewnULFARiK7ELCZFLhU,NAME_SEARCH,9rKy)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABSsNA8Bnxxfxo1NeMkzLo7pJfEcVqFODM4,NAME_SEARCH,vkMp)"}],"description":"Rapid urbanization and industrial diversification has led to generation of considerable amount of municipal, plastic, hazardous waste. Improper disposal of wastes often leads to spread of diseases and contamination of water bodies and soil. The impact of these wastes cannot be ignored and managing them has become a major problem. By the inoculation of different types of common microbes, the waste materials can be decomposed easily. This can be easily done by designing a bioreactor which consists of a mechanical separator. Thus we can separate the waste as biodegradable and non biodegradable. Thereby checking the Glucose content in the decomposed waste we can produce Ethanol. This project is intended for finding out new possibilities in municipal waste management and production of value added products from the same.

Considering the importance and increasing demand of this material, a systematic study based on properties and industrial applications has been carried out in this paper. The cultivation of rice results in two major types of residues Straw and Husk having attractive potential in terms of energy. Although the technology for rice husk utilization is well-proven in industrialized countries of Europe and North America, such technologies are yet to be introduced in the developing world on commercial scale. Every year approximately J 20 million tones of paddy is produced in India. This gives around 24million tones of rice husk and 4.4 mil\/ion tones of Rice Husk Ash every year. Major three uses of rice husk ash are in the steel, cement and refractory bricks industry. Besides this it can be utilized in several other applications. In India rice husk is used for cattle feeding, partition board manufacturing, so many small scale applications and rice husk ash is used in land filling, so many industrial applications. But this uses are not in a systematic manner and also rice husk has very low food value. Use of rice husk ash or rice husk in land filling is also an environmentally hazardous way of disposing waste. Rice straw is an attractive lignocellulosic material for bioethanol production since it is one of the most abundant renewable resources. It has several characteristics, such as high cellulose and hemicelluloses content that can be readily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars. The presence of high ash and silica content in rice straw makes it an inferior feedstock for ethanol production and production of furfural.","title":"Waste to wealth: potentinal value added products
