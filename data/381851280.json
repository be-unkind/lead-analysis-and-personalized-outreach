rodents. In this study, we investigated whether sub-chronic oral exposure to different doses of polyvinil pyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) (50, 100 and 200 mg\/kg\/day) could induce harmful effects on epididymal sperm rat parameters. Sperm motility, viability and morphology were examined. Moreover, a histological evaluation of testis and epididymis was also performed. High doses of PVP-AgNPs showed higher sperm morphology abnormalities, while a progressive, but not significant effect, was observed in other sperm parameters. The current results suggest that oral sub-chronic exposure to PVP-AgNPs induces slight toxicological effects in sperm rat parameters.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com.sabidi.urv.cat\/science\/article\/pii\/S0890623816300156","name":"Effects of oral exposure to silver nanoparticles on the sperm of rats","publisher":"Reproductive Toxicology 60,133-139","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABbClpABvsLILK46Nmiq0SdJPvU55-BQwOU,NAME_SEARCH,pYS2)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":21,"year":2016},"description":"Because of their extremely small size, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) show unique physical and chemical properties, with specific biological effects, which make them particularly attractive for being used in a number of consumer applications. However, these properties also influence the potential toxicity of AgNPs. In this study, we assessed the potential toxic effects of an in vivo oral sub-chronic exposure to polyvinyl pyrrolidone coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) in adult male rats. We also assessed if oral PVP-AgNPs exposure could alter the levels of various metals (Fe, Mg, Zn and Cu) in tissues. Rats were orally given 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg\/kg\/day of PVP-AgNPs. Silver (Ag) accumulation in tissues, Ag excretion, biochemical and hematological parameters, metal levels, as well as histopathological changes and subcellular distribution following PVP-AgNPs exposure, were also investigated. After 90 days of treatment, AgNPs were found within hepatic and ileum cells. The major tissue concentration of Ag was found in ileum of treated animals. However, all tissues of PVP-AgNPs-exposed animals showed increased levels of Ag in comparison with those of rats in the control group. No harmful effects in liver and kidney, as well as in biochemical markers were noted at any treatment dose. In addition, no hematological or histopathological changes were found in treated animals. However, significant differences in Cu and Zn levels were found in thymus and brain of PVP-AgNPs-treated rats.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0278691516301168","name":"Oral subchronic exposure to silver nanoparticles in rats","publisher":"Food and Chemical Toxicology 92, 177-187","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABbClpABvsLILK46Nmiq0SdJPvU55-BQwOU,NAME_SEARCH,pYS2)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":8,"year":2016},"description":"The present study was aimed at providing a better understanding of the influence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Cell line A549 was exposed to a range of concentrations of AgNPs, and a time course (up to 72 h) of cell viability was determined. We also determined the time course of gene and protein expression of p53, p21, murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and caspase-3. The expression of all of these proteins was also determined after daily exposure of the cells to 10 \u00b5g\/mL of AgNPs for 7 days, or after discontinuous exposure by treating the cells every 3 days, for 15 or 30 days. Moreover, epigenetic changes in the acetylation of the histone H3 protein and in global DNA methylation patterns were determined after 72 h of exposure. Results showed that daily exposure to low doses of AgNPs, or a single exposure to high concentrations for 72 h, decreased gene and protein expression of p53, p21, MDM2 and caspase-3 in A549 cells. In contrast, a discontinuous exposure to low doses or a single exposure to low concentrations for 72 h increased the levels of the active forms of p53 and caspase-3, as well as the p21 and MDM2 protein levels. In addition, exposure to high concentrations of AgNPs for 72 h induced higher levels of global DNA methylation and global histone H3 deacetylation in A549 cells. These results provide new information on the toxic action of AgNPs.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00204-016-1773-0","name":"Polyvinyl pyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles in human lung cancer cells: time- and dose-dependent influence over p53 and caspase-3 protein expression and epigenetic effects","publisher":"Archives of Toxicology 91, 651-666","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABbClpABvsLILK46Nmiq0SdJPvU55-BQwOU,NAME_SEARCH,pYS2)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715186460000,"insightId":"47b6df8c-0b70-4138-ae38-26ede55be1ff","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:job:3895044812"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":12},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194013589710516224","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194013589710516224","reactionsCount":14,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194013589244895232","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Dear Network, our Preclinical Safety team is looking for a motivated trainee that would like to develope the professional career in the field of toxicology.
