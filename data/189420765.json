data show how IPI-504 (retaspimycin HCl) degradation products resulting from solvent selection can be erroneously attributed to metabolites. The hydroquinone HCl salt IPI-504 readily converts to the quinone 17-AAG under ambient conditions; the hydroquinone salt is deprotonated and readily oxidizes to the quinone within minutes, presumably via oxygen-mediated transformation. An apparent redox equilibrium between the quinone\/hydroquinone pair is established soon thereafter in plasma due to enzymatic reduction and oxidation reactions. During a mouse mass balance study using [14C]-IPI-504, an abundant unexpected product was detected and assigned as a dioxidation metabolite (M27) to 17-AAG. Previous in vitro experiments in liver microsomes had not predicted this in vivo metabolite. To aid in structural elucidation of M27, a LTQ Orbitrap HRMS was employed.  Using both accurate mass and unique fragment ions, M27 was identified as a methanol adduct of 17-AAG and later confirmed by NMR, TLC and chemical synthesis. Initial metabolite profiling\/identification studies using a low-resolution MS did not differentiate between a dioxidation metabolite and methanol adduct, since both products share the same nominal mass, common fragment ions, and retention time. Unlabeled IPI-504 was administered to mice,plasma was collected and precipitated in three solvents: acetonitrile, methanol, and ethyl acetate.  Three unique peaks were detected in the samples prepared with methanol, all characterized as methanol adducts. Increasing the LC gradient to two hours also enabled separation of a dioxide metabolite and methoxide degradation product. Spiking na\u00efve mouse plasma with [14C]-IPI-504 and subsequent precipitation with either acetonitrile or acetonitrile:methanol mixture also resulted in significantly different profiles, the latter showing M27 and relatively lower abundance of 17-AAG.
