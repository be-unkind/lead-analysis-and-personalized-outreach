Dopamine-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa\u2013induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (Rhes+\/\u2212) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from Rhes-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of Rasgrp1, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the \u201cRhesactome,\u201d and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat\u2013containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain).

This oxidative modification modulates protein function by acting as a redox switch during cellular signaling. The identification of proteins that undergo this modification represents a methodological challenge, and its resolution remains a matter of current interest. The development of strategies to chemically modify cysteinyl-containing peptides for liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analysis has increased significantly within the past decade. The method of choice to selectively label sulfenic acid is based on the use of dimedone or its derivatives. For these chemical probes to be effective on a proteome-wide level, their reactivity toward \u2013SOH must be high to ensure reaction completion. In addition, the presence of an adduct should not interfere with electrospray ionization, the efficiency of induced dissociation in MS\/MS experiments or with the identification of Cys-modified peptides by automated database searching algorithms. Herein, we employ a targeted proteomics approach to study the electrospray ionization and fragmentation effects of different \u2013SOH specific probes and compared them to commonly used alkylating agents. We then extend our study to a whole proteome extract using shotgun proteomic approaches. These experiments enable us to demonstrate that dimedone adducts do not interfere with electrospray by suppressing the ionization nor impede product ion assignment by automated search engines, which detect a\u2009+\u2009138\u2009Da increase from unmodified peptides.

In this work we present an improved high-throughput quantitative proteomics method based on whole proteome concentration by SDS-PAGE, optimized in-gel digestion, peptide 18O-labeling, and separation by off-gel isoelectric focusing followed by liquid chromatography-LIT-MS. We demonstrate that the off-gel technique is fully compatible with 18O peptide labeling in any pH range. A recently developed statistical model indicated that partial digestions and methionine oxidation do not alter protein quantification and that variances at the scan, peptide, and protein levels are stable and reproducible in a variety of proteomes of different origin. We have also analyzed the dynamic range of quantification and demonstrated the practical utility of the method by detecting expression changes in a model of activation of Jurkat T-cells. Our protocol provides a general approach to perform quantitative proteomics by 18O-labeling in high-throughput studies, with the added value that it has a validated statistical model for the null hypothesis.

However, its clinical use is not devoid of side effects, among which hypertension and vascular injury represent a major drawback. Endothelial cells are able to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species upon exposure to CsA, including formation of peroxynitrite. This may result in endothelial cell toxicity and increased tyrosine nitration. We have now studied the subcellular origin of superoxide formation in endothelial cells treated with CsA and the biochemical consequences for the function of mitochondrial enzymes. By using electron spin resonance and endothelial cells lacking functional mitochondria, we showed that superoxide anion is generated in mitochondria. This was associated with an effect of CsA on bioenergetic parameters: increased mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibition of cellular respiration. In addition, CsA inhibited the activity of the mitochondrial enzymes aconitase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The use of murine lung endothelial cells deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NOS\/peroxynitrite inhibitors allowed us to establish that the presence of eNOS and concomitant NO synthesis and peroxynitrite formation were essential for CsA induced nitration and inhibition of MnSOD activity. As the latter has been shown to become inactivated by nitration, we sought to identify this modification by mass spectrometry analysis. We found that CsA induced specific MnSOD tyrosine 34 nitration both in the recombinant protein and in endothelial cells overexpressing MnSOD. We propose that CsA induced endothelial damage may be related to increased mitochondrial superoxide formation and subsequent peroxynitrite-dependent nitroxidative damage, specifically targeting MnSOD.","publisher":"Cardiovascular Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA8MzbMB_9rulAQDSUi7fI3jH9OllptcelU,NAME_SEARCH,WXZW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAkzFmUBjPpZ7w0za7sng9erVduDF6smlNk,NAME_SEARCH,fejQ)"}]},{"name":"Statistical Model to Analyze Quantitative Proteomics Data Obtained by 18O\/16O Labeling and Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry","publishedOn":{"year":2009},"description":"Statistical models for the analysis of protein expression changes by stable isotope labeling are still poorly developed, particularly for data obtained by 16O\/18O labeling.

Although the study of mechanisms underlying biological actions promoted by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on endothelial cells is of considerable interest, quantitative proteomics studies on this subject are scarce and have been performed after exposing cells to the factor for long periods of time. In this work we present the largest quantitative proteomics study to date on the short term effects of VEGF on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by 18O\/16O labeling. Current statistical models based on normality and variance homogeneity were found unsuitable to describe the null hypothesis in a large scale test experiment performed on these cells, producing false expression changes. A random effects model was developed including four different sources of variance at the spectrum-fitting, scan, peptide, and protein levels. With the new model the number of outliers at scan and peptide levels was negligible in three large scale experiments, and only one false protein expression change was observed in the test experiment among more than 1000 proteins. The new model allowed the detection of significant protein expression changes upon VEGF stimulation for 4 and 8 h. The consistency of the changes observed at 4 h was confirmed by a replica at a smaller scale and further validated by Western blot analysis of some proteins. Most of the observed changes have not been described previously and are consistent with a pattern of protein expression that dynamically changes over time following the evolution of the angiogenic response. With this statistical model the 18O labeling approach emerges as a very promising and robust alternative to perform quantitative proteomics studies at a depth of several thousand proteins.

Today it is possible to identify and determine relative expression levels of thousands of proteins in a biological system by MS analysis of peptides produced by proteolytic digestion. In some situations, however, the precise characterization of a particular peptide species in a very complex peptide mixture is needed. While single-fragment ion-based scanning modes such as selected ion reaction monitoring (SIRM) or consecutive reaction monitoring (CRM) may be highly sensitive, they do not produce MS\/MS information and their actual specificity must be determined in advance, a prerequisite that is not usually met in a basic research context. In such cases, the MS detector may be programmed to perform continuous MS\/MS spectra on the peptide ion of interest in order to obtain structural information. This selected MS\/MS ion monitoring (SMIM) mode has a number of advantages that are fully exploited by MS detectors that, like the linear ion trap, are characterized by high scanning speeds. In this work, we show some applications of this technique in the context of biological studies. These results were obtained by selecting an appropriate combination of scans according to the purpose of each one of these research scenarios.
