One of which is our alumni programme #WeBelong. \n\nWeBelong is a community where we welcome young people from our WeDiscover and WeGrow programmes to take the next steps to wherever that might be. This could be the world of work, further educational opportunities, volunteering or exploring. Our WeBelong community and team are there to walk alongside our Gappies for however long they need.\n\nDuring the past couple of weeks, we have spent quality time with our WeGrow Flintshire group as they get ready for their next steps. As part of this transition, we have included these key elements of WeBelong; Employment, Education, Learning and having fun!\n\nSo what did we get up to?\n\nFor our Fun and Learning element we visited #Liverpool. This involved a train journey, a visit to Liverpool Museum, a walk around the Albert Dock and time to explore Liverpool. We had lots of fun, enjoyed new experiences and loved spending quality time together. Added bonus, the sun was shining too!\n\nThe following day we were given our own private tour of Coleg Cambria by our wonderful tutor Shell, who has been leading sessions at our Jade Jones hub during the past 6 months. The tour allowed our Gappies to see the outstanding provision and services available at Coleg Cambria\u2019s Deeside campus and to ease their worries over attending future education and learning opportunities there. \n\nWe then visited Net World Sports in Wrexham and were welcomed by Gareth Davies who gave us an insight into how Networld Sports started, how it\u2019s continuing to expand and what the employment opportunities and benefits they have. We also had a great tour. Thank you to both Shell and Gareth for welcoming us and the time spent with our Gappies.\n\nThe week ended with one-to-one sessions with each of our Gappies to hear how we can support them to take their next steps and what element of WeGrow is important for them to continue. It was no surprise to hear that their friendships and the opportunity to see each other was the common theme.\n\nWe're excited to welcome our Gappies into the WeBelong community, where they'll find continued support and a network of peers ready to journey alongside them.\n\nHere's to the next chapter and all the adventures it holds!  Thankyou Sian Hughes our WeBelong lead for creating an amazing transition week.\n\nTomorrow night is #Graduation!!!\n\n#UKSPF #Flintshire #WeGrow #WeBelong #Community"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7184242273633628160"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7184243159558717441"}}},{"createdAt":1712332680000,"insightId":"05dd64a8-9fc5-48d4-a5ef-0803c57c8e5e","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":19},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":6}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7182044037468536835","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7182044037468536835","reactionsCount":25,"commentsCount":4,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7182044036873015297","message":{"attributes":[{"start":138,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dn2QEZSv"}}},{"start":165,"length":29,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:2366741"}}},{"start":264,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:27247629"}}}],"text":"Belonging\u2026\u2026my post on belonging got so many responses, I wanted to write some more about it.\n\nSo here is the link to my first ever Blog!  https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dn2QEZSv\n\n\nThe Centre for Social Justice Two Nations report made such an impact on me, and on the back of our  WeMindTheGap Big Conversation findings, where many young people told us that they don\u2019t feel that they belong, that I wanted to share my thoughts on the importance of Belonging in the key area of Education.\n\nFor many of the young people we have the pleasure of working with, school and education wasn\u2019t for them!  \n\nIs that because they didn\u2019t feel like they belonged?\n\nPlease read my blog and importantly the report, I\u2019d love your thoughts and always happy to debate :-)"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQHPKA4gidi6EQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712328265575?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=tRaO6QnTNoaF-fGwECDRq_LX5D0vJNdSbpY35WxGVdg","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQHPKA4gidi6EQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712328265575?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=tRaO6QnTNoaF-fGwECDRq_LX5D0vJNdSbpY35WxGVdg"}]},"description":"Bridging the belonging gap.
