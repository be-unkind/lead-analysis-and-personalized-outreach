The paper concludes that the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower numbers. LAY ABSTRACT: It is of importance that pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare pharmacies review the types and numbers of microorganisms found within their clean areas. Such examination should be carried out over a long period of time so that the complete picture can be revealed. This is important in order to understand if certain species are being recovered pose a product or environmental risk and to check if the cleaning and sanitization practices are effective.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22293526","name":"A review of cleanroom microflora: types, trends, and patterns","publisher":"PDA J Pharm Sci Technol.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEkjhcBnaa4aN5vRftkg1tqmor5NtwMTtI,NAME_SEARCH,LJ7j)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":1,"year":2004},"description":"Environmental Monitoring describes the microbiological testing undertaken in order to detect changing trends of microbial counts and micro-flora growth within cleanroom or controlled environments.

Modern autoclaves are computer-controlled and reliably provide a defined sterilization cycle. When steam enters the autoclave chamber and contacts with the item to be sterilized, steam collapses (condenses). Water formed must be discharged through condensate management or re-vaporized in order to prevent wet loads. Repeated occurrences of wet loads are indicative of a major fault with the sterilizer, potential non-sterilized materials, and other problems. This paper considers some of the potential causes for wet loads and addresses some of the measures that can be taken to address occurrences. Topics discussed include reasons for wet loads, causes including wet steam, inadequate condensate removal, steam trams, pressure control, and other causes; diagnosing problems by information collection, and corrective actions. Corrective actions may include vacuum drying, heating the load before steam introduction, an air in-bleed phase, and other approaches. Problems identified may be caused by a combination of factors requiring a multidisciplinary team to evaluate potential causes.","url":"https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/14306492\/Ensuring_Sterility_Autoclaves_Wet_Loads_and_Sterility_Failures","name":"Ensuring Sterility: Autoclaves, Wet Loads, and Sterility Failures","publisher":"Journal of GXP Compliance","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEkjhcBnaa4aN5vRftkg1tqmor5NtwMTtI,NAME_SEARCH,LJ7j)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":1,"year":2015},"description":"In time, efforts were made to create methods to solve the conflicts arising in human society. From this point of view, we took into account the discussion of certain new methods to solve different conflicts other than the regular ones. Mediation appeared as a reaction to the inefficiency of the inexistent methods of solving different types of conflicts. It is a well-elaborated process, within which the conflicting parties may express their opinions and interests. As well, mediation enables decision making within the involved group or by each individual. Moreover, this process requires the intervention of a mediator to facilitate the discussions of the parties.

A study was undertaken to assess the levels of airborne contamination in a changing room during use. \n\nTo assess this, a changing room was examined under different conditions: at-rest; occupied (with different numbers of personnel); and post-use.

Discriminatory power of spa typing was higher (89.4%) than MLST typing (80.5%). The overall agreement between spa typing and MLST at a type level was 39.2%. This has been proved with directional index of partition relation (adjusted Wallace) indicating no more 60% congruence.\n\nConcordance between spa and MLST typing data were not so high at a type level because of difference in their discriminatory power. At the same time, level of agreement between MLST and spa clonal complexes reached 89.4%. Snp correction of MLST clonal complexes excluding MLST types with 3 and more bases distance from clonal complexes have led to 97.2% concordance.

These attributes are legislated requirements intended to protect the recipient patient. Sampling, microbiological testing, interpretation of data for final products, raw materials and intermediates all contribute to a cohesive assessment in the assurance of finished product quality. Traditional culture-based microbiological methods possess inherent and unavoidable variability, recognized by the compendia and which might lead to erroneous conclusion pertaining to product quality. Such variability has been associated and intrinsically linked with data integrity issues; manufacturers have subsequently been encouraged by regulatory authorities to introduce multiple microbiologists or checks to prevent such issues. Understanding microbiological variability is essential such that genuine data integrity issues are identified. Furthermore, a range of meaningful preventative strategies are feasible beyond increasing the capacity of the quality control microbiological laboratory.

This is primarily in relation to non-sterile pharmaceuticals. Fungal contamination of such products can lead to a reduced shelf life through deactivating the active ingredients or presenting a health hazard to patients. Many of the reasons for fungal contamination are due to deficiencies in facility design, inadequate process controls, or materials issues. It is the facility design and operation issue which is addressed in this article. In relation to this, due to several product recalls associated with fungal contamination (as discussed below), the issue of fungal contamination in cleanrooms has seemingly received more attention from regulators. \n\nFungal issues associated with pharmaceutical cleanrooms, cold rooms and controlled areas are regularly reported, such as through regulatory surveys on major GMP issues and through issued warning letters. Fungi are a particular concern in cleanrooms because they form spores and, once present in an area, fungal spores are ubiquitous, spread relatively easily, and they can be difficult to remove.

Materials and methods: The study included 44 MDR K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii microorganisms. The bacteria were screened for the presence of biocide resistant genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The test organisms were isolated from various clinical specimens in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. The in vitro susceptibility tests of the three biocides (benzalkonium chloride, cetrim-ide and chlorhexidine gluconate) were studied against the test isolates by broth microdilution method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results: With the distribution of biocide resistant genes in K. pneumoniae, all 9 isolates (100%) possessed cepA; 4 (44.4%) and 1 (11.1%) isolate contained qacA and qacE genes respectively. Among 24 isolates of A. baumannii tested, cepA, qacA and qacE genes were found in 54.2%, 16.7% and 33.3% of isolates respectively. Among 11 P. aeruginosa isolates, 63.6% contained cepA gene, 18.2% contained qacE genes, and none of the isolates harboured qacA gene. There was no significant correlation between presence or absence of biocide resistant genes and high MIC values of the test isolates (p \u2265 0.2).

What is more difficult is the content of some of the standards themselves because they have not been written specifically for the healthcare sector or the pharmaceutical industry (more typically they have evolved from the food, cosmetics or environmental control sectors). It may be necessary for the microbiologist to adapt the standards to suit practical situations (backing this up with a well-thought out rationale). Another point to be considered before embarking on such validation is whether all of the standards are to be replicated or whether experimental work required by some of the standards can be provided by the manufacturer of the disinfectants.\n\nGiven that most regulators and microbiologists regard the surface test as the most meaningful of the laboratory methods, this paper addresses this test.

Monitoring data is assessed against assigned limits (or frequencies) and by assessing the collected data over time in the form of trend analysis. Importantly, environmental monitoring is used to confirm that sufficient controls are in place; in itself it cannot be used as a substitute for control.\nThere are several aspects to environmental monitoring and each aspect must be described in an environmental monitoring program; such elements include method selection, determining frequencies of monitoring, locations for sampling, selection of culture media, choice of data analysis tools and so on.

Docking studies of ketoconazole were performed using 1PW4 (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter from Escherichia coli which was the representative structure from the major facilitator superfamily).\nResults: Ketoconazole significantly decreased the MICs of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and EtBr (a substrate for efflux pump) by 8 to 1024-fold (P<0.01) and decreased the efflux of EtBr. Furthermore, a time-kill assay revealed that combinations of levofloxacin with ketoconazole or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone showed no growth for the tested strains after 24 h in comparison to the effect of levofloxacin alone. Docking studies and the ability of ketoconazole to diminish the relative expression of NorA gene in comparison to control (untreated strains) confirmed its action as an efflux pump inhibitor. \nConclusion: The findings showed that the antifungal ketoconazole has no antibacterial activity but can potentiate the activity of the fluroquinolones against MDR S. aureus via inhibiting efflux pump and biofilm formation in vitro.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/333679872_A_novel_mechanism_of_action_of_ketoconazole_inhibition_of_the_NorA_efflux_pump_system_and_biofilm_formation_in_multidrug-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","name":"A novel mechanism of action of ketoconazole: inhibition of the NorA efflux pump system and biofilm formation in multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","publisher":"Infection and Drug Resistance","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEkjhcBnaa4aN5vRftkg1tqmor5NtwMTtI,NAME_SEARCH,LJ7j)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":1,"year":2019},"description":"For conventional culture based microbial methods and with many rapid and alternative microbiological methods, the way that method suitability is demonstrated is with the recovery of known populations of microorganisms.

Wounds heal by the control of moisture and by a process of staving off infection; while dressings have addressed the former over centuries, with the latter specialized dressings are being developed. Dressings to aid wound healing have been used for several decades, such as the use of hydrocolloid dressings to help treat burns and with the application of hydrogels for wounds that are leaking little or no fluid. However, it is in more recent years that antimicrobial compounds have been incorporated.\n\nThis involves the addition of physical or chemical processes designed to kill any pathogenic microorganisms that might be present, and which pose a risk of triggering a disease such as sepsis (where the chemicals that body\u2019s immune system releases into the bloodstream to combat an infection trigger inflammation throughout the entire body) or delay the rate of wound healing (one of the causes of delayed wound healing is the presence of microorganisms in the wound).

With sterile manufacturing, for instance, the wider availability of single-use, sterile disposable technologies should be being designed into the process. This extends from bioreactors to biocontainer bags for taking samples for bioburden analysis.\n\nPerhaps the most important single invention in recent years is the aseptic connector. These provide secure, simple, and economical connection for high fluid throughput in upstream\n\nand downstream and eliminate the risk that is presented from the gloved hands of personnel attempting to make a connection. With aseptically filled products, ideally there are no connections downstream from the final sterilizing grade filter.

The fluorescent viability marker is taken up by organisms, where bacterial metabolism causes an enzymatic cleavage of the non-fluorescent substrate. This reaction causes the liberation of a free fluorochrome into the cytoplasm of the cells. As such, after incubation for 30 minutes, when the membrane is viewed under a UV lamp, viable colonies fluoresce. The advantage of the fluorescence is that colonies not visible to the human eye can be detected earlier on in the incubation process, shortening incubation time.  \n\nTo illustrate the reduced incubation times that can be achieved using the technology, this paper looks at the incubation times for purified water.  Analysis of data using One-Way ANOVA demonstrated a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 6 days Milliflex Quantum Method Incubation Time for purified water samples. Overall, the process comprises of 2 - 6 days incubation at 30-35\u00b0C post filtration (as determined by this study) followed by Milliflex Quantum dye incubation step with a 30-minute incubation and plate read using the Milliflex Quantum reader. Hence, it was determined that the Quantum system was able to detect colonies several days before they became visible to the naked eye.

Depending on the product type, there are complexities involved. Bacterial endotoxin can form a stable interaction with other biomolecules thus making its removal difficult especially during the production of biopharmaceutical drugs. The detection of endotoxin (generally synonymous with lipopolysaccharide where the molecule\u2019s lipid A moiety possesses most of the biological activity) is important for patient safety due to its pyrogenic properties and ability to trigger a form of septic shock. \n\nIn addition, endotoxin can be difficult to detect when bound with protein in the human body. This makes endotoxin testing for certain applications significantly challenging, especially for drug development and medical research, such as screening patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.\n\nTo meet this challenge, innovations in endotoxin testing are being developed in the form of biosensor technology. The most promising of these is a form of electrochemical aptasensor2 which detects endotoxin through voltammetric determination of lipopolysaccharide. Aptamers show great affinity toward their target analytes, such as with endotoxin. The aptamer recognizes the molecular target against which it was previously in vitro selected. There are several such sensors in research use and the development phases are promising. Furthermore, these technologies have the potential to meet the requirements of \u2018rapid microbiological methods\u2019 in that they meet the criteria of good performance, accuracy, repeatability and had a shorter time-to-results.

Hence, the implementation of automation technologies, techniques and processes improve the efficiency, reliability, and\/or speed of many tasks that were previously performed by humans. Expanding upon this concept, \u2018what automation is\u2019 in the pharmaceutical process, a simple example is with an automatic control loop. Here a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. \n\nHence, workplace automation is a means of combining a series of simple, repetitive tasks to create a straightforward, streamlined flow of operations, without the risk of human error. Utilizing the benefits of automation is one of the essential elements of industry 4.0. Drivers for automation also include economic pressures, such as business disruptions, safety concerns, regulatory requirements, customer service, financial problems, and competition.

Companies that do not adapt are going to slowly lose their ability to take on new projects or to help develop new medicines relative to other firms. As with other industries, any task that is standardized and repeated frequently is an opportunity for automation. Many processes tend to include a number of simple, yet time-consuming tasks. When automated, the tasks tend to be performed more efficiently and consistently, and the work output itself is usually higher quality because the potential for human error has been removed as a potential factor. Finally, the personnel previously allocated to handling these tasks is now freed to focus on the more complex aspects and value judgements of a process, generating even greater business value. \n\nMachines, computers, and databases have made many automations possible over the last several decades; however, these are nowhere near their maximum potential.

Attachment is a physical activity; as bacteria approach a surface, cell appendages (such as fimbriae, pili, and flagella) may stick to it. Adhesion can occur when adhesive molecules expressed on the bacterial surface bind to host surface receptors; this is associated with biofilm formation. In both cases, bacteria can sense that they are in contact with a surface and provide the initial cellular responses to surface contact and subsequent adhesion. FIt is important to note that surface roughness and cleanability have a relationship, but the relationship is complex. A rougher surface may increase the potential for microbial attachment although to a degree cleanability is subject to variations in terms of the presence of other substrates and time as microorganisms move from the reversible to the irreversible state.\n\nAn important factor related to this consideration, especially for when cleanroom equipment is selected, is the surface finish and surface roughness. This focus on topography is particularly useful for stainless steel given the commonality of this material, along with anodized aluminum, for the production of pharmaceutical processing equipment. Hence, specifying appropriate finishes and limits of roughness should form part of equipment and facility specifications, as informed by the principles of quality by design. Durability and resistance to corrosion represent important reasons as to why material grade, finish, and roughness matter. In addition, these specifications are also determinants of the likelihood of microbial attachment and hence they are essential considerations when developing a contamination control strategy. This review paper assesses the factors affecting finish and roughness, primarily in relation to microbial attachment to stainless steel. The objective is to aid with developing equipment design specifications and User Requirement Specifications.","url":"https:\/\/www.ivtnetwork.com\/article\/importance-not-being-too-attached-pharmaceutical-equipment-characteristics-and-bacterial","name":"The Importance of Not Being Too Attached: Pharmaceutical Equipment Characteristics and Bacterial Attachment","publisher":"Journal of GxP Compliance","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEkjhcBnaa4aN5vRftkg1tqmor5NtwMTtI,NAME_SEARCH,LJ7j)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":30,"year":2021},"description":"Many organizations within the pharmaceutical and healthcare space will be developing projects within the quality space.

Consequently, since details about clinical trial participants often remains underreported in medical journals, the physician deciding on the optimal treatment for a female patient may not be choosing the most appropriate intervention. Alternatively, the side effects of a medication can be different between men and women.3\n\nWhere these biases occur, they undermine the potential that AI presents to translate, scale, and accelerate drug development insights. In addition, if the base algorithm or the training data for an ML model contains some form of bias, it is extremely likely that the resulting models will perpetuate that bias when recommending subject data sets and for interpreting trial data sets.\n\nSandle, T.(2022) Can AI\/ML Help Solve Underrepresentation In Clinical Trials?, Clinical Leader, 26th April 2022: https:\/\/www.clinicalleader.com\/doc\/can-ai-ml-help-solve-underrepresentation-in-clinical-trials-0001 \n\nAlso published in:\n\nSandle, T.(2022) Can AI\/ML Help Solve Underrepresentation In Clinical Trials?, Life Science Leader, 1st July 2022: https:\/\/www.lifescienceleader.com\/doc\/can-ai-ml-help-solve-sex-bias-in-clinical-trials-0001","url":"https:\/\/www.clinicalleader.com\/doc\/can-ai-ml-help-solve-underrepresentation-in-clinical-trials-0001","name":"Can AI\/ML Help Solve Underrepresentation In Clinical Trials?","publisher":"Clinical Leader","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEkjhcBnaa4aN5vRftkg1tqmor5NtwMTtI,NAME_SEARCH,LJ7j)"}]},{"name":"Technologies and GxP considerations for vaccine development","publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":17,"year":2022},"description":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines made global headlines in 2021 in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 (through the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines).

immune system insight","fullText":"Protein homeostasis refers to the balance of proteins within cells, involving processes such as protein synthesis, folding, modification, transport, function, and degradation. Proteins in cells participate in nearly all life activities, maintaining normal physiological functions. Disruption of protein homeostasis can lead to the occurrence and development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Therefore, maintaining the balance of protein homeostasis is crucial for normal physiological functions in the human body. Traditional targeted drugs mainly block protein function by occupying binding sites, including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. However, due to the complexity of protein function and limitations in targetability, some proteins are difficult to treat using occupancy-driven methods. Challenges in small molecule targeted drug development The classical mode of action of small molecule drugs is \u201coccupancy-driven\u201d. Since the FDA approved the first oral small molecule targeted therapy for tumors-tamoxifen targeting the estrogen receptor (ER) -in 1977 for the treatment of breast cancer, small molecule drug development has typically focused on screening for high-affinity inhibitors. Small molecule inhibitors can bind to the active sites or allosteric sites of proteins to abolish their function, which is an \u201coccupancy (of a specific site on the target protein) driven (loss of function of the protein)\u201d mode of action. Small molecule inhibitors face two major challenges: resistance mutations and difficult-to-drug targets. On the one hand, patients who respond to small molecule inhibitors eventually develop resistance, mainly due to resistant mutations. On the other hand, the \u201coccupancy-driven\u201d mode of action requires explicit pockets\/grooves on the target protein that can be occupied by small molecules. However, some protein pockets\/grooves are very shallow or even lack catalytic regions, resulting in less than ideal effects of small molecule inhibitors. These target proteins are often referred to as difficult-to-drug targets. Protein targets that act in the form of protein complexes Inhibiting one subunit of a protein complex is difficult to completely deactivate the complex. Additionally, protein-protein interactions are difficult to block with small molecules. Therefore, protein complexes have traditionally been considered difficult-to-drug targets, such as the PRC protein complex involved in epigenetic regulation and the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. Protein targets with scaffold functions Some proteins do not depend on or lack enzymatic catalytic sites themselves but indirectly exert their function by binding\/recruiting other proteins. Binding of small molecule drugs to such proteins is difficult to completely abolish the function of the target protein, with representative proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Recently, BTK has also been found to have scaffold functions. Protein targets with numerous homologous genes Some proteins have multiple homologous genes, and these homologous proteins have highly similar structures and sequences (especially in kinase active regions) but different functions. Selectivity of small molecule inhibitors for specific target proteins may be relatively limited, leading to significant side effects, with representative proteins such as the CDK family. Due to limitations of small molecule inhibitors, two-thirds of potential targets have not been drugged. There are approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human body, and current research indicates that about 10% of these proteins are associated with disease, accounting for approximately 2,000 potential targets. However, according to a 2017 review by NRDD, at that time, the FDA had approved only 667 target proteins out of 1,578 drugs, with small molecule drugs targeting 549 and large molecule drugs targeting 146, accounting for only one-third of potential targets. A large number of potential targets are limited by the limitations of small molecule drugs in drug development. Two Major Systems Based on Protein Degradation In eukaryotic cells, there are two major systems responsible for protein and organelle degradation: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome system. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the core mechanism for degrading damaged or misfolded proteins inside cells, participating in the degradation of over 80% of cellular proteins. Its main process involves: first, ubiquitin (Ub) forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1); activated ubiquitin is transferred to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) through thioester exchange reaction; then, ubiquitin ligase (E3) simultaneously binds to the \u201cE2-ubiquitin complex\u201d and the target protein, bringing them into close proximity in space, driving ubiquitin transfer to the target protein. This process is ATP-dependent, and repeated cycles can mark substrates with ubiquitin chains, ultimately recognized and degraded by the proteasome. In addition to the UPS, another degradation pathway mediated by lysosomes exists widely in eukaryotes. This pathway involves a wide range of substrates, including senescent or damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and invading pathogens, complementing the UPS. The lysosomal degradation pathway mainly includes the endosome-lysosome pathway (ELP) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Therefore, targeted degradation techniques based on ELP are mainly applied to extracellular proteins and membrane proteins, such as \u2002LYTAC ; ELP refers to the process in which cells fuse extracellular substances or membrane proteins with endosomes through receptor-mediated endocytosis and ultimately transport them to lysosomes for degradation. ALP usually refers to the process of wrapping substrates in autophagosomes with the participation of key autophagy protein LC3 and eventually fusing with lysosomes for degradation. Targeted degradation techniques based on ALP further expand the technical means for targeting intracellular proteins (including protein aggregates) and have been successfully applied to degrade damaged organelles and other non-protein biomolecules. Based on the two pathways mentioned above, targeted protein degradation technologies operate on an \u201cevent-driven\u201d rather than an \u201coccupation-driven\u201d mode of action. In theory, they only require catalytic amounts of drugs to exert strong therapeutic effects, showing significant advantages in targeting \u201cdifficult-to-drug\u201d targets, improving selectivity, overcoming resistance, and reducing toxic side effects, with broad application prospects. Advantages of PROTAC Technology Compared to traditional small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs can degrade non-enzymatic proteins, undruggable proteins, etc. They are expected to have higher activity and selectivity and possess a catalytic effect, potentially enabling low-dose, low-frequency dosing. Compared to monoclonal antibodies, PROTACs can target a large number of intracellular targets, with stronger tissue penetration, and can be administered orally. Both siRNA and PROTACs can achieve protein degradation, but siRNA has a short half-life and is easily degraded, and drug delivery remains a critical limiting factor for its application. PROTAC technology has comprehensive advantages in targeting undruggable proteins, overcoming resistance, selectivity, and drug administration routes, with great development potential and broad application prospects. Currently, the majority of PROTACs bind reversibly to both the target protein and the E3 ligase through reversible interactions. Inspired by covalent small molecule inhibitors, covalent PROTACs have emerged. By introducing electrophilic groups into PROTACs, they can form covalent bonds with the target protein or E3 ligase without compromising their catalytic properties. Therefore, they can maintain longer drug efficacy and show some advantages in improving degradation efficiency and selectivity. Electrophilic groups capable of forming covalent bonds with the target protein are introduced into PROTACs, such as reversible covalent PROTACs designed based on the electrophilic group cyanoacrylamide. There are over 600 E3 ligases in the human body, each showing unique substrate specificity. Therefore, designing PROTACs that covalently bind to E3 ligases can enhance PROTACs\u2019 degradation efficiency and selectivity. It is also another approach to develop new E3 ligase ligands. Demonstration of catalytic degradation of targeted proteins by reversible covalent PROTACs (Guo, Wen-Hao, et al . 2020) Compared to small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs have the advantage of lower effective doses and higher efficiency. However, due to the presence of E3 ligase ligands, PROTACs may interact with other targets besides the target protein, leading to off-target effects and related toxic side effects. For example, CRBN-based PROTACs may not only degrade the target protein but also degrade other targets such as the translation termination factor GSPT1, leading to off-target effects. Homo-PROTAC is a new form of conventional PROTAC, which is directly linked by two identical\/different E3 ligase ligands. The dimerization of E3 ligase ligands themselves can dual-hijack E3 ligase to selectively induce their degradation. The advantage of Homo-PROTAC compared to traditional PROTACs is that they do not bind to other targets, thereby avoiding the occurrence of toxic side effects. Currently, Homo-PROTACs targeting MDM2, VHL, and CRBN have been reported, providing a new method for achieving selective degradation of E3 ligases. Currently, most PROTACs target a single target in the protein family or different subtypes of the same target. Since multi-target inhibitors and bispecific antibodies have been successful, designing PROTACs that can simultaneously degrade two or more different targets may achieve better therapeutic effects and expand the application of PROTAC technology. PROTACs act through an event-driven mode, and compared to traditional small molecule inhibitors, they can rapidly achieve high activity at low doses in an enzyme-catalyzed manner. However, this makes it difficult to control activity by adjusting drug doses. In addition, similar to small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs may also cause off-target effects. When administered systemically, PROTACs cause irreversible degradation of both normal cells and tumor cells in the body, leading to the occurrence of side effects. To overcome this problem, researchers have attempted to control protein degradation with high spatiotemporal resolution through external modulation, such as phosphorylation control and light control. Light, due to its convenience, efficiency, and precision, has been widely used as an external control method for regulating protein degradation in recent years. Light-controlled PROTACs can be divided into two types based on their mechanisms of action: photo-cleavable PROTACs (PC-PROTACs) and photo-switchable PROTACs (PS-PROTACs). Although numerous PROTACs have been reported targeting different targets, most PROTACs cannot distinguish between different types of cancer cells, leading to poor tissue selectivity. Inspired by antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) , researchers have proposed a novel design strategy called antibody-PROTAC conjugates (Ab-PROTAC) to improve the tissue selectivity of PROTACs. Ab-PROTAC typically connects an antibody that can specifically target tumor cells with a PROTAC molecule through linkers of different lengths, and theoretically, the linker can be connected to any part of the PROTAC. The hydroxyl group in hydroxyproline on the VHL ligand has been shown to be a suitable connection site. After the PROTAC binds to the antibody, it loses its degradation activity, and is then selectively recognized by tumor cells. The active PROTAC is subsequently released and exerts its degradation activity. Therefore, Ab-PROTACs are expected to exhibit better tissue specificity and lower toxicity. Folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) is highly expressed in various types of cancer cells and is a common target for targeted drug delivery in anticancer therapy. A series of folate-PROTAC conjugates are obtained by linking folate groups to the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline on the VHL ligand of PROTACs via ester bonds. The folate moiety can be specifically recognized by FOLR1, and subsequently, FOLR1 mediates the entire conjugate to enter and accumulate in cancer cells. Finally, under the action of endogenous hydrolases in cells, the ester bond in the conjugate is cleaved, releasing active PROTAC to degrade the target protein. Nucleic acid aptamers, known as \u201cchemical antibodies,\u201d are single-stranded nucleic acids that can specifically bind to target proteins. Nucleic acid aptamers have advantages such as convenient synthesis, good water solubility, excellent tissue specificity, and penetration. APC 40 is obtained by connecting a highly active BET PROTAC with a nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411 through a glutathione (GSH)-sensitive linker. This conjugate can specifically recognize breast cancer cells MCF-7 with high nucleolin expression, and then, in the tumor microenvironment, the linker is cleaved to release the original active PROTAC, which selectively degrades the BRD4 protein. Compared to the original PROTAC molecule, APC 40 has higher tumor tissue selectivity and lower toxicity. It can selectively recognize MCF-7 tumor cells and accumulate in tumor tissues. As a new generation of drug technology, PROTACs have gradually completed proof-of-concept validation, and some products have achieved positive results in clinical phases I\/II. They are expected to overcome resistance to existing products or breakthrough undruggable targets, bringing new opportunities for incremental investment in the small molecule field.

Safety measures to take while collecting blood, what risks you may face, and how to avoid them","fullText":"Blood donation (designed by Tim Sandle) B lood collection is the most common way of diagnosing a patient's health. It not only detects the conditions or status of any diseases, but blood testing also helps prevent the risk from increasing. But the most important thing to consider in the entire process is to know which needles to use. These days, there are many types of needles available for collecting blood samples. Wondering what these needles are? Because each needle has its own features and uses, not every one of them is the same. In addition to different types of needles, the sizes also vary. So to help you better understand, here are the different types of needles that are used for blood collection. Butterfly needles also known as winged infusion needles sets are thin and short in design. It has butterfly wings due to its two plastic appendages on either side. They mostly have a gauge range between 18 to 27. These are best suitable for patients who have blood disorders, seizures, etc or people with fragile and thin veins. It can be used both on children as well as adults as it is easy to use. Hypodermic needles are hollow needles used for collecting blood from a vein. These are the most commonly used as they are fast and safe to use. It is best suitable when it comes to fast delivery of fluids into a patient's body. The gauge size ranges between 16 to 30 and they come in various sizes. The best part is that these needles are easily connected to syringes. Vacutainer needles provide a whole system of collecting blood into a vacuum blood collection tube. With the use of this needle, the process becomes easier, thanks to the rubber sleeve at one end that helps create a vacuum within the tube itself. Talking about size, you can choose from 1 to 1.5 inches and the gauge ranges between 19 to 22. Another needle used for collecting blood is the blood collection disposable needles. These are typically disposable and are designed for single use. These are highly in demand as they reduce the risk of contamination, ensuring more safety and hygiene during the blood-collecting procedure. These needles come in various sizes and the gauge ranges between 18 to 25. Straight needles are blood collection needles best suitable for multiple samples. It is straight, and thin and can attach many tubes. These are available in 21 and 22-gauge and offer accurate venous samples. Even though it comes with fewer needlestick injuries, healthcare professionals must be careful when using it as it might be painful for the patient. Surgilance One-Step Needle is a micro-blood sampling device and is a single-use needle. It is one of the safest and easiest methods as it minimizes the risk of needlestick injury. The best thing about this needle is that it is not painful for the patient as it gently pricks the skin for blood sample collection. Working with blood-collecting needles requires safety precautions for both the blood collector as well as the patient. And to help you, here are safety issues you must follow when collecting blood using needles: When dealing with blood collection needles, always make sure to clean your hands and wear gloves throughout all blood draws. Once done with the procedure, remove and discard the glove immediately. Also when changing gloves, remember to wash your hands or you can also use alcohol-based cleansers. If washing hands with soap and water, the duration must be between 40 to 60 seconds and if using alcohol-based solutions then the duration will be between 20 to 30 seconds. Talking about needles, they shouldn't be recapped even if not used. The infected needle from a blood collection unit shouldn't be disposed of, instead the tube holder assembly and the needle must be disposed of together. Also to prevent injuries remember to use the right needles. When collecting blood, taking care of patients is much as important as taking care of the needles. It is stated that most people faint or pass out before or after giving blood samples, so always stay alert beforehand. So when collecting blood, grip your patient's shoulder and upper arm firmly. Also, bear in mind to stop collecting blood if a vein gets suddenly provoked. Also, a needle and syringe used shouldn't be reused for any other patient. Even though blood collection sample is a serious process, if not done properly it can lead to several risks. The very first risk that occurs due to improper blood collecting procedures is inaccurate results. If this is what happens, then the patient will have to undergo the procedures again bearing the inconvenience. Other risks involved with improper blood collecting sample procedure are passing out or loss of consciousness, bruises, pain, swelling around the area, infection blood clots, bleeding and discomfort.

Researchers still have a lot to learn, but they know aspects such as a person\u2019s diet, environment and DNA can influence the body\u2019s microbiota. Further work in this area could result in pharmaceutical companies making individualized drugs for specific patients rather than using mass-market approaches. What progress has happened so far? Mutated genes occur in 60% of colorectal patients , with over 20% of TP53-mutated tumor cases linked to shorter survival periods and more aggressive disease forms. Researchers have also learned that such mutations can disrupt the gut microbiome. Recently, a group made another valuable discovery that could further personalize medicine. The team identified microbiota signatures associated with colorectal cancer and those mutations, believing the gut could contain non-invasive biomarkers identifying disease subtypes. Studying those might reveal new findings to support diagnostic methods and a clearer understanding of patients\u2019 cancer progression. The researchers used 16s rRNA sequencing to examine stool samples from 94 patients with colorectal cancer. Their approach revealed 24 samples containing the specific mutation \u2014 the rest had the non-mutated gene. The mutant sample group also had 24 gut microbiota types not present in the other specimens, while three were categorized as non-invasive colorectal cancer biomarkers. Experts found that the non-mutated samples contained two microbes linked to probiotic activity. Although they will need to investigate further with a larger patient cohort, the team believed those two bacteria types could reduce a patient\u2019s likelihood of developing the genetic mutation in their tumors. Such outcomes could support learning more about the disease\u2019s progression and tailored treatments . Some precision medicinal work has examined patient response to particular treatments , which could significantly reduce severe side effects or ineffective therapies. The information could also tell medical practitioners what preliminary steps to take so that interventions get the best results. Specialized equipment has undoubtedly spurred microbiome research. Some types can show high-resolution images of specimens as thin as 1 nanometer in width , helping scientists observe on the molecular level. Such advancements also support large-scale studies featuring data collected from multiple locations. In one 2022 study, researchers gathered biome data from five sites in three countries to learn about patient responses to melanoma treatments. The results showed that patients with three specific bacteria types in their guts responded better to immunotherapy than those without. The experts also discovered potential links between external factors like patients\u2019 diets, proton pump inhibitors and the microbiome makeup. The team eventually hopes to determine which microbiome characteristics most impact immunotherapy responses. Capitalizing on those could enable pharmaceutical companies to create personalized treatments. This study reinforces the importance of gut health and a good diet, as the researchers determined patients who had both were nearly 50% as likely to survive after five years. This outcome could also encourage doctors to prescribe dietary changes or probiotic supplements before patients\u2019 treatments. Scientists have become more interested in metabolomics, the study of a system\u2019s small molecules. As they learn more about molecular interactions with human cells, the takeaways could influence the future of microbiome research. However, metabolomic studies can usually only characterize about 10% of the molecular microbiome data from each sample. In December 2023, a team of microbiome experts introduced a pioneering approach they call \u201creverse metabolomics,\u201d which provides an improved understanding of the microbiome\u2019s impact on human health. This new approach combines data science, mass spectrometry and organic synthesis. The team\u2019s first application of their method allowed them to observe hundreds of molecules for the first time. They used those insights to identify a new metabolomic signature associated with inflammatory bowel disease, believing it could improve diagnostics and treatments for people with the condition. Reverse metabolomics allows for checking samples for specific molecules and predicting which microbes produce them. These findings facilitate efforts to find links between health and disease. In one example, the team examined a synthesized class of microbial molecules called bile amidates and found potential inflammatory bowel disease markers across multiple cohorts. However, some variations existed. For example, active Crohn\u2019s disease symptoms caused specific bile amidate elevations in patients, but researchers did not see the same results in those with ulcerative colitis. Additional experiments suggested several bile amide compounds could disrupt T-cell function and inflame the gut. Once scientists learn more about such patterns, they can use them to diagnose specific medical issues and customize treatments. These researchers envision a future where patients receive live microbe-containing pills that secrete particular molecules. Alternatively, new drugs could work by inhibiting the enzymes associated with disease-linked molecular interactions . Although researchers are in the early stages of understanding the human microbiome, these examples show significant improvements. As such innovations progress, patients can look forward to instances where they get tailor-made medicine for their specific symptoms and conditions. Such interventions could dramatically enhance their quality of life and reduce the likelihood of disease complications resulting in hospitalizations or emergency care.

This article looks at the importance of sterility test compliance and how M-Trace \u00ae can deliver the solution. The pharmacopeial test for sterility is one of the most important laboratory tests and a regulatory requirement for aseptically filled pharmaceutical products. A test recording a \u2018pass\u2019 result, together with evidence of sterility assurance during manufacturing, provides evidence of the quality of the manufactured product. The most common form of the test is the membrane filtration method, where the presence or absence of microorganisms is assessed through an examination of turbidity, following incubation, of microbiological culture media. Maintaining the validated state The criticality of the test places it under regular audit scrutiny, from the validation of the test to its routine performance. Sterility test validation is performed to develop a test method through which it can be demonstrated that the product does not have a microstatic or microbicidal effect. To show that the test has been conducted effectively and following the initial validation, a series of parameters need to be controlled (such as the use of the correct membrane filter; the speed at which the product is passed through the membrane filter; and the number of rinses required to remove any potentially antimicrobial product residues). These parameters often vary between products and include: Many of these parameters need to be submitted as part of the regulatory filing for new products. It is also important that the validated conditions are accurately captured in the test procedure and replicated by each analyst who performs the test. It is also important to carefully record the culture media used (typically soya-bean casein digest and fluid thioglycolate media). These media need to undergo quality control testing and release, before being used in the sterility test. The release process includes growth promotion testing (using pharmacopeia strains and isolates from the facility\u2019s own manufacturing environment) and a \u2018sterility test\u2019 (incubating some of the test bottles to show the absence of contamination). Use of the incorrect culture medium will lead to test invalidation. In addition, the consumables used in the sterility test also need to be captured, including the test kit and rinse fluids. Different test kits and rinse fluids may be required for different product families, and knowing which consumables were used is essential should a sterility test failure investigation be required. The adherence to the validated state and traceability requirements must conform to data integrity expectations. This is especially critical for a final product release test like the sterility test. A useful acronym when considering data integrity, and one that serves as an appropriate summary point, is ALCOA. Here: data must be attributable, legible (permanent), contemporaneous, original and accurate. This means: From the above, where a computerised system is used, the system must: To help address the above best practice requirements, Merck has developed a means of ensuring that sterility tests are conducted as designed and validated (through the use of electronic standard operating procedures) and that all consumables are captured and connected with the relevant sterility test. This is through M-Trace \u00ae , a system that ensures the sterility test achieves an improved state of compliance. The use of the electronic procedure also ensures that operational steps are not missed or performed out of order and that any ambiguity or different interpretation between analysts is minimised. The first part of the system is the M-Trace \u00ae Software. This enables semi-automated control of the Merck Steritest \u00ae Symbio Pump (used for the sterility test using the membrane filtration method). The analyst can view the software and control the operational steps via a headset and voice commands or directly from the Symbio Pump display. This streamlines the workflow and, through the avoidance of errors or delays to verify the required steps, it can boost productivity. Automating the workflow: M-Trace \u00ae Touch Mobile Computer The second part of the system is a mobile device, which resembles a smartphone, used to scan and digitally capture the data matrix codes of consumables. With this, Merck has developed a digital companion called the M-Trace \u00ae Touch Mobile Computer. Capturing test consumables accurately is not only important; this is an area that can be prone to error within a busy laboratory, especially within the sterility test suite here personnel will be wearing cleanroom-style gowns and gloves. The M-Trace \u00ae Touch Mobile Computer enables consumable data to be captured accurately and the automation element ensures that no consumables are missed, and that traceability is achieved through automation. Where scanning is undertaken within the sterility test facility, the M-Trace \u00ae Touch Mobile Computer is positioned outside of the Grade A zone (outside of an isolator or unidirectional airflow device), using the M-Trace \u00ae Mobile Computer Mount, enabling the analyst to perform the scanning hands-free. Laboratory compliance: M-Trace \u00ae Electronic Test Record Software When the user is within range of the M-Trace \u00ae All-in-One PC (MTRACEPC1) the data is transmitted to the electronic test record. Hence, the M-Trace \u00ae Mobile App connects to M-Trace \u00ae Electronic Test Record Software. This enables the analyst performing the sterility test to digitally capture records of consumables used in the sterility test together with test results. In addition, the digital information can be integrated into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), here a laboratory supervisor or manager can review the test parameters and consumables prior to releasing the result. The M-Trace \u00ae system aids the laboratory in improving compliance by reducing the potential for error (in terms of testing and data capture) and provides an electronic repository to enable the accurate release of test results and a digital archive should test problems or failures be encountered, as well as providing a means for an auditor to examine historical test results. The life science business of Merck operates as MilliporeSigma in the U.S. and Canada .
