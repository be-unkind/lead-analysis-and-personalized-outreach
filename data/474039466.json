As late as 8.11 am.The ticketing procedures are one on the train platform and also in the train or rather trams( The last I saw was in Nov 2013).Trams that run internally in the city area are an attraction.\n4) When I say system,I mean the huge shopping centres  like huge malls and shopping \ud83d\uded2\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f is DIY.The sensor installed at the entrance which makes a beep beep if any of the item is not paid.Every area will have one shopping mall.\n5) When I say system,I mean the banks will have a queue method and no chaos,and no one can squeeze in between,and while the bank teller is talking to the customer ,the others in the queue cannot see your information.They are at a distance.\n6) Traffic \ud83d\udea6 at the roads is good.But then there are people who make mistakes,but rarely.The Parking rules are good and are given space and timings to park with a ticketing machine in the front.\n7) When I say system, I mean drinking water is available 24\/7.Hot water system is available 24\/7.Cooking gas is supplied underground during the building of the house.The drains are underground.\n8) When I say system,I like the dressing pattern at work meant for a particular industry.(Certainly the other lot try to wear clothes with too much of Hollywood type of show,which I did not like and I keep it out of my ways.Once upon a time I tried to follow it just to get on with the ways but really I hated it.)\n9) When I say system,I mean the educated lot who are running the system to make it technologically efficient.Not the fully tattooed , \ud83c\udf1e sun soaking sea side,and living on the Dole expanding in weight by a 90 kg,.\n10) When I say system,I mean the fluent English that is spoken with clear accents,the women who were ambitious, working and not the ones carrying too many children in the pram with a Dole to support.\n\nSo here I am following what I liked.I like learning languages and let's talk of Japan.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/g5vda7Rw"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7200066353121169408"}}},{"createdAt":1716468300000,"insightId":"6828f72e-ed99-4955-be80-cf217d698a92","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7199389901803429888","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7199389901803429888","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7199389899072942081","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1977,"length":22,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"mailto:princeshah@hotmail.com"}}}],"text":"I was browsing through the job section on Facebook and I came across this advertisement from Nexus Medodent.I have been reading the catalogue of Nexus Medodent for a while.\nPosting this as I find it very skillful enough and is based in Mumbai \n\n\nJob Title: Dental Technology Specialist**\n\n**Company:** Nexus Medodent \n\n**Location:**Mumbai \n\n**About Us:**\nWelcome to Nexus Medodent (NMD) where innovation meets affordability in the dental materials industry.

The appliance here serves a more aesthetic and comfortable option for patients needing habit control for tongue thrusting and retention of treatment results.  Its dual functionality allows it to serve as both a retainer, maintaining teeth alignment post-treatment, and a trainer, guiding the tongue to a proper position.
