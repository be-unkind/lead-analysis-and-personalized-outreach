{"summary":"As a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and Registered Dance\/Movement Therapist (R-DMT) I primarily work within a person centered approach, valuing and respecting the individual\u2019s capacity for resilience and the ability to navigate and orient towards healing. My specialized training and experience in dance\/movement therapy has enabled me to conceptualize and treat the individual from a holistic perspective. I am well equipped to acknowledge and interface with the many complex dimensions of the person, including the connections between mind, body, and spirit. I have a sincere commitment to multicultural education, to recognizing and honoring diverse populations, and participating in the training and self-awareness needed to engage in effective, culturally sensitive practice.\n\nMy experience includes providing dance\/movement therapy group and individual services to youth, adults, and older adults with varying physical\/psychological\/neurological trauma, developmental disorders, psychiatric diagnoses, and behavioral challenges. I have witnessed the meaningful and measurable changes in clients\u2019 well-being, solidifying the impact that effective dance\/movement therapy can have on participants\u2019 felt sense of healing.\n\nIn addition to  my clinical roles, I am also a choreographer, commissioned to create original work for local universities, as well as provide workshops on dance\/movement therapy, and guest present for university Creative Arts in Therapy programs.\n\nI am currently expanding my private practice to include a consultation arm to implement my skills and knowledge in Industrial\/Organizational Psychology (I\/O Psych certificate obtained in 2018). Consultation services will include mental health psychoeducation to help hospital\/healthcare employees recognize, respond to, and recover from burnout through neuro-somatic skills, creative expression, and dance\/movement therapy foundational principles (non-clinical interventions).","lastName":"Glace, MA, LPC, R-DMT ","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:181487447","geoRegion":"West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States","fullName":"Jillian Glace, MA, LPC, R-DMT","firstName":"Jillian","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"LIBRATUM COUNSELING, LLC","description":"Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) at group practice seeing individual clients.

Months and years apart for the duration of the Afghan conflict.  Until 3 years ago on this day 8 March 2021, my husband of 17 years, Colonel Nick Carrell, died from a rapid and aggressive form of brain cancer, whilst still serving.\n\nIt was then I realised that I didn\u2019t know everything about being an army spouse. I didn\u2019t know that we had 93 days to vacate our home, that my children would soon become ineligible for their eductional bursaries, that my VO would be permitted to support my devastated little family for just six weeks, as they had other more important things for her to do elsewhere ..\n\nI learned that after two weeks, no one from the MoD calls, that they think when they\u2019re handed you a purple pack and an indecent pension that they have \u201cextracted from the bereaved family as clinically as possible \u201c , their words not  mine.  I learned that no one talks about transition for the spouse or breakfast clubs or drop ins. And for our bereaved children they lose their home, their school, their identity and their parent. \n\nWe had to leave the community we\u2019d lived in for almost 2 decades - were we still armed forces ? No, we\u2019re not serving. Were we veterans ? No we never served.\n\nSo who are we ? We\u2019re adrift and so are so many other military bereaved families.\n\nI am working to change the narrative around our military bereaved, to bring together the families, the MoD, the armed forces charity sector, the NHS and other support pathways because we must do better for families who have lost their loved ones whilst serving this country .\n\nThis was our last homecoming. Nick had been in Kabul for 8 months with no R&R.\n\nPlease help me to spread the word to help raise awareness in galvanising better support to the military bereaved community and in bringing about systemic change in the space that the armed forces community gives to families like mine.
