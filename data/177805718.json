A young girl cried wolf- calling against the right of a trans woman to use the women's locker room. Right-wing media stirred itself up into a national frenzy that eventually led to heated protests and a dramatic Santee City Council meeting about who should and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use public locker rooms. \n\nThe initial news media didn\u2019t name the transgender woman in question, but she came forward to address the mischaracterizations and stand up for her community.  Christynne (Chrissy) Lili Wrene Wood came forward as the Black transgender woman in the locker room and invited supporters to stand up with her.  At the time that her presence and identity were suddenly called into question, she had been taking that same YMCA aqua aerobics class for years. \n\nChrissy recently told her story \u2013\u2013 in her own words, in the Union-Tribune. She reminded us of the weight of the anti-Blackness buried in this allegation and controversy, drawing a clear line between this incident - when the words of a young white girl questioned this Black woman\u2019s right to be in the same locker room - to the events preceding the lynching of Emmett Till in 1955. \n\nThis not-so-distant history was on many of our minds, and as we\u2019re making our history now, we\u2019re also changing the story we tell about Black trans folks. This includes writing new endings about how we as a community show up for our Black siblings. In this case, Chrissy\u2019s community showed up in force, led with love, strength and joy by Chrissy herself. \n\nIn the face of considerable hate and controversy, Chrissy maintained strength and never lost her joy.  She infused unwavering faith into the community rallied around her. In 2023, San Diego Pride presented her with the Spirit of Stonewall Champion of Pride Award for her indisputable status as an icon and a pillar in our community.\n\nAs we hit the midpoint of Women\u2019s History Month, we invite you to join us in celebrating the women who are making history now with us. We have so many trans and queer women in our community who transform the fear and hate they face into love, who create spaces for queer and trans joy and celebration. They stare down transphobia and racism and feel called to take action to protect not only themselves but their communities. \n\nI call on my fellow white folks and non Black people of color to actively appreciate the Black folks and Black women in your circles. Search for ways you can pick up some of the burden of fighting homophobia and transphobia. \n\nThank you, Chrissy, and thank you to all the trans, lesbian, bisexual, and queer Black women and women of color that are making history now.  \n\nWith Pride, \n\nJen Hibberts (she\/they)\nOrganizing & Outreach Coordinator\n\nFull newsletter >> mailchi.mp\/sdpride\/1124"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7174154987663486976"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7174224820820172800"}}},{"createdAt":1709917620000,"insightId":"2fb4c7f2-6fc7-45e1-9ac0-c0fc5cfa114f","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"title":{"text":"Brian Health Research - PA Lab"},"mediaType":"PAGINATEDDOCUMENT"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":4}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7171914358204100608","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7171914358204100608","reactionsCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7171914358204100608","message":{"attributes":[{"start":329,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:seniorcare"}}},{"start":341,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:alzheimers"}}},{"start":353,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:research"}}},{"start":363,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:sandiego"}}}],"text":"It's always exciting to see the great work and research that my organization is doing for Brain Health and Alzheimer's. \n\nLet's work together to raise awareness, promote acceptance, and fight back!
