","description":"Purpose: To evaluate the effects of immediate and extended release gabapentin on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain in women undergoing hysterectomy.\n\nDesign: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nMethods: Ninety-two subjects were randomized to receive gabapentin immediate release 300mg, gabapentin enacarbil extended release 600mg, or a placebo pre-operatively. Post-operative pain and PONV were assessed using a 0-10 scale from arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit through the first 24 hours of hospital stay. Analgesic and antiemetic use was recorded. \n\nFindings: In post-hysterectomy women, gabapentin immediate release showed a statistically significant decrease in morphine equivalents at one hour postoperatively, with a trend toward decreased pain and PONV throughout the 24-hour stay.\n\nConclusions: Given the relatively low cost of immediate release gabapentin, minimal risks associated with this mediation, and potential benefit to patients, it should be considered as an appropriate adjunctive multimodal therapy for gynecology surgery patients. \n","publisher":"Submitted to Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHZDZsBeT7pIo1o2hxE-Ja3dfVzmWZbhk4,NAME_SEARCH,Taah)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1711669680000,"insightId":"9dd01c4f-3ddf-4e75-a210-df7a123d9677","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7177962373079535616,7179263097147138048)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7177962373079535616","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congrats Heath!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7177962373079535616"}}}]}
