A 78-year-old woman presented with onset of panuveitis after initiation of pembrolizumab therapy for metastatic melanoma. The patient received three cycles of therapy every 21 days, during which her symptoms progressively worsened. She was treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, and further pembrolizumab was discontinued despite a good response to therapy. Pembrolizumab has been associated with rapid onset of ocular inflammation and uveitis. PD-1 inhibitors mediate a T-cell response against cancer cells; however, autoimmune complications have been reported. Incidence of pembrolizumab-induced uveitis is reported to be < 1%. To date, three cases have been reported since its Food and Drug Administration approval in September 2014. Uveitis, if left untreated, may lead to permanent vision loss and ocular damage. Cases of immune-mediated uveitis have been reported with cancer immunotherapies. Oncologists and ophthalmologists should be aware of this complication.

While the advent of PPIs has improved patient outcomes, controversy still exists over optimal PPI therapy for UGIB. Pharmacologic treatment in combination with endoscopic therapy has demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with nonvariceal UGIB. PPIs are the treatment of choice for suppressing gastric acid and preventing rebleeding, though a mortality benefit from these agents has not been strongly established. Although the current guidelines recommend an i.v. bolus injection followed by continuous infusion of a high-dose PPI, intermittent PPI therapy has been found to be safe and effective while significantly reducing cost, even in patients with high-risk stigmata after endoscopy. Oral PPIs may be effective in patients who can tolerate oral therapy but require further evaluation in patients with higher-risk stigmata. Regardless of stigmata, after 72 hours of i.v. therapy, patients with UGIB may be safely transitioned to oral PPIs if hemodynamically stable and able to tolerate oral medication. As the risk of rebleeding significantly decreases after the first three days, continuation of high-dose therapy beyond 72 hours is not necessary in hemodynamically stable patients.\nConclusion: Current guidelines recommend that PPIs be given as an i.v. bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion, but intermittent i.v. dosing and oral PPI therapy have been found to be effective in treating patients with UGIB and associated with reductions in cost.","url":"http:\/\/www.ajhp.org\/content\/74\/3\/109","name":"Optimizing proton pump inhibitor therapy for treatment of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding","publisher":"American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_A5-gB7xicZ1De5pc7GxKEio1S_p-yfn0,NAME_SEARCH,bRND)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":26,"year":2017},"description":"Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the second most common malignancy of the genitourinary system and the sixth most common cancer in the United States.

Standard treatment includes complete surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy with a regimen of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine. Treatment with single-agent temozolomide is an acceptable alternative. Myelosuppression is typically the dose-limiting toxicity associated with temozolomide; in rare cases, aplastic anemia has also been reported.\u00a0\n\nObjectives: To review the literature of temozolomide-induced aplastic anemia and discuss the case of severe aplastic anemia in a patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma who received temozolomide therapy.\u00a0\n\nDiscussion: We report a case of aplastic anemia in a 36-year-old white woman who had surgery for anaplastic oligodendroglioma followed by radiation and temozolomide therapy. Aplastic anemia is a rare and has been reported with temozolomide therapy. Increased toxicity of temozolomide caused by limited activity of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene could contribute to prolonged marrow damage. If the\u00a0MGMT\u00a0promoter is methylated, cells are unable to repair DNA crosslinks and are rendered sensitive to alkylating agents.

The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2019, more than 42,000 individuals will be diagnosed with HCC, and nearly 32,000 individuals will succumb to the disease. Despite an overall decline in cancer-related deaths in the United States, mortality rates due to liver cancer have increased and rank as the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death. Chronic hepatitis B and C infections and alcohol consumption are the leading risk factors for the development of HCC in the United States. Screening is recommended for individuals at high risk of developing HCC, and patients with early-stage disease may undergo surgical resection, ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, radiation therapy, or liver transplantation. Patients diagnosed with late-stage or metastatic disease have limited treatment options. Prior to 2018, sorafenib was the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapy for the initial treatment of unresectable HCC; nivolumab and regorafenib were approved in 2017 as second-line options following treatment with sorafenib.

Data collected included the type of malignancy, chemotherapy regimens, and patient comorbidities. Recommendations from the NCCN and from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the published literature regarding regimens associated with febrile neutropenia were used to determine appropriate therapy. Adults who had a diagnosis of cancer and received G-CSFs as prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia were included in this analysis. \n\nRESULTS: A total of 72 patient encounters associated with filgrastim therapy and 1439 patient encounters with pegfilgrastim therapy were analyzed. The results demonstrated that 47.22% and 8.2%, respectively, of G-CSF administrations did not have an indication supported by guideline recommendations for administering filgrastim and pegfilgrastim as prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia. In addition, this evaluation helped to identify a potential saving of more than $600,000 annually. In all, 4.66% of pegfilgrastim treatment was administered on the same day as chemotherapy administration, despite guideline recommendations for a 24- to 72-hour wait period between the administrations of chemotherapy and G-CSF.\n\nCONCLUSION: The use of G-CSFs at this large institution suggests that the prescribing of these medications is not always in adherence with the current NCCN guidelines. Our analysis helped to implement a systemwide pharmacist reference in collaboration with the medical oncologists in setting criteria to aid in the management of G-CSF therapy and provide optimal patient care.","url":"http:\/\/www.jhoponline.com\/jhop-issue-archive\/2019-issues\/jhop-september-2019-vol-9-no-3\/17833-comparing-granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factors-prescribing-practices-versus-guideline-recommendations-in-a-large-community-cancer-center","name":"Comparing Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factors Prescribing Practices versus Guideline Recommendations in a Large Community Cancer Center","publisher":"Journal of Hematology Oncology Pharmacy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_A5-gB7xicZ1De5pc7GxKEio1S_p-yfn0,NAME_SEARCH,bRND)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA6rgLEBE5InM9yu4yrx3-MoSu30AOcr3qo,NAME_SEARCH,nQrK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAaWs3EB48vTzWXIuDsHnqOwDIujCV7JJj0,NAME_SEARCH,YEIS)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":16,"year":2019},"description":"Oral chemotherapy agents have significantly altered the provision of cancer therapy, allowing cancer to be managed as a chronic condition within the patient\u2019s home.

An estimated 32,110 new myeloma cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019, with an estimated 12,960 deaths, which represents 2.1% of all cancer-related deaths. MM is most frequently diagnosed in people aged 65 to 74 years, with a median age of 69 years at diagnosis and a median age of 75 years at death. \n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network MM panel prefers triplet therapy over doublet as the standard of care for all patients because of improved response rates, depth of response, and rates of progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival.3 The combination of a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and a corticosteroid remains the cornerstone of frontline treatment for patients, regardless of eligibility for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). As an example, the bortezomib\/lenalidomide\/dexamethasone regimen is a preferred category 1 recommendation for transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients.\n\nMany agents administered as frontline therapy for patients with MM are used in the relapsed\/refractory setting. Choice of therapy is influenced by what was used in the frontline setting, patient comorbidities and organ function, response assessment from prior treatment, tolerability of prior therapy, and time to relapse. Despite numerous treatment combinations, the primary goals of therapy for all patients with MM are disease control, improved quality of life, and prolonged survival. MM remains incurable to date.

Due to the high rate of anemia, many patients with MDS require red blood cell transfusions (RBCT), which, in turn, are associated with a high clinical and economic burden. In the phase 3 randomized COMMANDS and MEDALIST clinical trials, luspatercept reduced the severity of anemia among transfusion-dependent (TD), erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)-refractory and ESA-naive patients with lower-risk (LR)-MDS (Platzbecker U, et al.

This expansion has created knowledge and practice gaps among community oncology providers in administration protocol and adverse event (AE) management. This study was initiated to assess practice patterns, monitoring and management of treatment-related AEs, supportive care services, and barriers to treatment. Methods: A survey was distributed in May 2023 to multidisciplinary oncology providers who treat patients with multiple myeloma. Included were nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, hematologists oncologists, oncology nurses\/navigators, and pharmacists. The survey was semi-structured, with most questions having multiple choice answers or being Likert-type questions. Additionally, survey results were further explored and affirmed in two provider focus groups comprised of seven survey respondents. Results: There were 114 survey respondents. Under half (49%) of the respondents reported being \u201cfamiliar\u201d or \u201cvery familiar\u201d with updated clinical practice guidelines. Respondents reported a need for additional resources, including multiple myeloma-specific educational materials (45%), guidance\/information regarding clinical trial availability (44%), recommendations on sequencing therapies (41%), increased availability of social workers\/mental health providers (40%), and information on managing AEs (32%). On average, respondents from community centers indicated being \u201cless than confident\u201d about the management of AEs in both CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific agents than respondents from academic centers. Just 50% reported that patients are monitored weekly. Most respondents (62%) indicated that a survivorship discussion is initiated upon diagnosis, but the remainder (37%), indicated that survivorship planning occurs only by patient request. Concerns about comorbidities and patient fitness, as well as cost of care and supply issues, were among the top barriers reported when considering subsequent lines of therapy. Conclusions: This study highlighted ways to improve the care of patients with multiple myeloma. Provider and patient education on new treatment regimens continue to be important, and support for programs that facilitate communication between academic and community practices may help more patients access new therapies and receive appropriate monitoring for AEs.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/jnccn.org\/view\/journals\/jnccn\/22\/2.5\/article-BPI24-017.xml","title":"BPI24-017: Optimizing the Implementation of New Therapies in Multiple Myeloma","sourceDomain":"jnccn.org"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":77},{"type":"PRAISE","count":4},{"type":"INTEREST","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194104447457718273","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194104447457718273","reactionsCount":83,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194104446866399232","message":{"attributes":[{"start":55,"length":6,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:jnccn"}}},{"start":69,"length":46,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:69524"}}},{"start":804,"length":34,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:287644"}}}],"text":"Multiple Myeloma - Our survey results published in the #JNCCN of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae) demonstrate:\n\nUnder half (49%) of the respondents reported being \u201cfamiliar\u201d or \u201cvery familiar\u201d with updated clinical practice guidelines. \n\nRespondents reported a need for additional resources, including multiple myeloma-specific educational materials (45%), guidance\/information regarding clinical trial availability (44%), recommendations on sequencing therapies (41%), increased availability of social workers\/mental health providers (40%), and information on managing AEs (32%). \n\nOn average, respondents from community centers indicated being \u201cless than confident\u201d about the management of AEs in both CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific agents than respondents from academic centers.\n\nAssociation of Cancer Care Centers"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194104446866399232"}}},{"createdAt":1713113100000,"insightId":"cc1728c2-f9d1-4f93-9607-66e0e1c80f2c","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQG7bPMQTWH4ag\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712844087731?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=zPSaWNUxAgBE3KYR4ET_2GC4R3smAH0vy_bzqESt6vY","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQG7bPMQTWH4ag\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712844087731?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=zPSaWNUxAgBE3KYR4ET_2GC4R3smAH0vy_bzqESt6vY"}]},"publishedAt":1712844000000,"description":"Kirollos Hanna, PharmD, BCPS, BCOP, FACCC, addresses some of the considerations for bispecifics in relation to facility readiness at different sites and among different stakeholders.","fullText":"Pharmacy Times interviewed Kirollos Hanna, PharmD, BCPS, BCOP, FACCC, on his presentation at the Hematology\/Oncology Pharmacy Association (HOPA) Annual Conference 2024 in Tampa, Florida titled \u201cKey Considerations for Operationalizing Bispecifics in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.\u201d Hanna discusses some of the specific considerations for bispecifics in relation to facility readiness, and the role of the pharmacist in operationalizing bispecifics at their facilities. Pharmacy Times : Teclistamab-cqyv was approved by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Is this the only bispecific currently being used to treat this disease state, or are other bispecifics being used as well? Kirollos Hanna, PharmD, BCPS, BCOP, FACCC: When we look at the myeloma space, the BiTE [bispecific T-cell engager] era has really expanded significantly since 2022. So when you look at teclistamab-cqyv [Tecvayli; Janssen Biotech, Inc], it was the first bispecific therapy in myeloma, and it is a BCMA-targeted therapy. Now, while BCMA is not a new mechanism within myeloma, we've had ADCs [antibody drug conjugates] and other therapeutics targeted, [but] teclistamab-cqyv was the first to market. Then you also look now and where we are with myeloma, we have talquetamab [Talvey; Janssen Biotech, Inc], which targets GPRC5D. Then we also have elranatamab [Elrexfio; Pfizer], which is another bispecific within this space. So, we have 3 exciting opportunities that we can utilize for different therapeutics for patients. And when you look at the current approval for these drugs, across the board, they are in a penta refractory patient population, so 4 lines in. There is a lot of ongoing research within this space, and it's likely that we're even going to see these therapeutics move into earlier lines of myeloma. There are a lot of things we have to operationalize for our patients as well, but it's very, very exciting. To show you the impact that these bispecifics have had on myeloma patients, back in 2015 or 2016, we had daratumumab (Darzalex; Janssen Biotech, Inc) approved in myeloma, this was the first CD38 monoclonal antibody approved. And since daratumumab, in this penta refractory patient population, we have not seen degrees of complete responses and overall responses anywhere remotely as close as what we saw back in the daratumumab days. So you look at teclistamab-cqyv, for example, and you look at the MajesTEC-1 trial [NCT04557098], and I mean, the overall response rate is about 60% to 70%. But then even when you look at the degree of patients who have a very good partial response or better, or a CR or better, it is a significant group of patients that ultimately will benefit from therapy and will have a long durable response. Given that it's a penta refractory patient population, these therapies are really exciting. It's going to be interesting to see in the next coming years, how these change the paradigm of myeloma. Pharmacy Times : What are some of the specific considerations for bispecifics in relation to facility readiness, and 2 years after the FDA approval of teclistamab-cqyv and 10 years after the approval of blinatumomab, are there still challenges in this area? Hanna : So bispecifics facility reading readiness is very, very important. While we've had bispecifics in the market for quite some time going back to the blinatumomab days, we now have, like I mentioned, 3 in myeloma, we have bispecifics in uveal melanoma, and we have a lot of ongoing bispecifics that have PDUFA dates this year, and then a lot of clinical trials that continue to look at different targets of bispecific. So, when you talk about facility readiness, it's critical that facilities develop some type of processes for them to be able to administer bispecific therapeutics, because this space is up and coming. And we're going to see quite a few therapeutics in the next coming months and years. So, what are some of those things around facility readiness? You're going to have to look at the facility infrastructure. Are you an academic institution? Do you have a hospital-affiliated with your system? Are you a community practice? And if you are a community practice, what does that look like? What are relationships that you have with local hospitals or local emergency rooms, because when you look at some of these bispecifics, some may have a REMS [risk evaluation and mitigation strategy] program, some may not have a REMS program, but really across all of the bispecifics, cytokine release syndrome, ICANS [immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome], neurotoxicity, infections\u2014these are all shared adverse events between these therapeutics, and facility readiness is very, very important to ensure that we can ramp up patients safely. [Also, that] we have the proper supportive care measures in place, we have the adequate staff that's trained and familiar with some of these adverse events and the management of these adverse events, and, again, developing these relationships with other systems. I work currently for community oncology, and a hot topic within the community is how do we operationalize bispecifics when things like the package insert of these products and then the prescribed labeling says patients should be hospitalized. People don't really know how to operationalize that, especially if they're not affiliated with a hospital. So, there's some worry and some concern, for example, around ramping up patients, because also when you look at some of those adverse events like the CRS, ICANS, and neurotoxicity is the highest incidence, where you might see this is when that patient is being ramped up when they're first exposed to therapy. So those operational considerations are very important, so developing things like SOPs, relationships with hospitals that you can refer to and you can get your patients refer back based on the resources and the infrastructure available, but it is inevitable that practices will need to develop this out. Now, the exciting thing is that while we're limited in terms of direction of what the prescribed labeling may provide, you look at, for example, Emory put out a publication about 2 to 3 weeks ago around prophylactic tocilizumab [Actemra; Genentech, Inc] administration prior to bispecific therapy. And when you look at the incidence of how they were able to reduce the incidence of CRS, it was very significant in the tocilizumab prophylaxis patients. There are ongoing groups that are going to be publishing around safe outpatient administration. Going back to my daratumumab example, which I highlighted, back in 2015-16 when daratumumab was first approved, it was this monoclonal antibody in a penta refractory population with significant concerns around infusion reactions or infusion-related reactions. [There were] very long infusion time and health care systems did not know how to best operationalize that. You look at daratumumab today, we have subcutaneous, we have rapid infusion, we can eliminate pre-medications, and this is exactly what's going on with bispecific era. We have adverse events that we're going to continue to learn how we can manage or prevent. And then we're ultimately going to start seeing protocols that help in the event that those adverse events do manifest that you have outpatient support for these patients. And in small steps that you might require hospitalization and such. But again, that facility readiness, your HCPs [health care professionals], your sites, every stakeholder that would touch that patient does need to have some type of familiarity with bispecifics.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.pharmacytimes.com\/view\/bispecifics-in-multiple-myeloma-insights-on-operational-readiness-and-patient-care","title":"Bispecifics in Multiple Myeloma: Insights on Operational Readiness and Patient Care","sourceDomain":"pharmacytimes.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"PRAISE","count":9},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1},{"type":"LIKE","count":110},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":5},{"type":"INTEREST","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7185317280120029184","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7185317280120029184","reactionsCount":126,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7185317279490846720","message":{"attributes":[{"start":40,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1631989"}}},{"start":62,"length":47,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:28173963"}}},{"start":307,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gvizUt9W"}}},{"start":419,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gnGAHF5k"}}}],"text":"I had the pleasure of sitting down with Pharmacy Times at the Hematology\/Oncology Pharmacy Association (HOPA) Annual Conference to highlight important considerations for the adoption of BiTE therapies in myeloma care across different practice settings. \n\nInsights on Operational Readiness and Patient Care: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gvizUt9W\n\nRole of the Pharmacist in Institutional Readiness, Patient Readiness for Bispecifics: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gnGAHF5k"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7185317279490846720"}}},{"createdAt":1712400600000,"insightId":"1c10a257-1082-478d-9d6f-1e1f4ae40085","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:multiPhoto:1000146594556"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":304},{"type":"PRAISE","count":34},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":22}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7182328860825333760","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7182328860825333760","reactionsCount":360,"commentsCount":15,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7182328860825333760","message":{"attributes":[{"start":37,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:3301095"}}},{"start":119,"length":5,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:9395313"}}},{"start":126,"length":47,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:28173963"}}},{"start":175,"length":27,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1324833"}}}],"text":"What a week?!
