The Mattel brand\u2019s latest car, for example, was developed in conjunction with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network to better include children with autism. The Flippin Fast is a car that rolls just as well upside down as it does right side up. It has large wheels that suspend the body at their midpoints, and the car is symmetrical along its x-y diagonal. In other words, the front chin spoiler on one side becomes the rear wing on the other. Traditional cars have a top and a bottom, a front and a rear. The Flippin Fast isn\u2019t limited by those orientations, and thus offers a more open-ended play experience according to Hot Wheels. The fun doesn\u2019t stop there. A rotating center piece that includes the cockpit also spins independently of the car body, so kids can use the toy as a fidget spinner if they so choose. This feature offers an additional sensory aspect that some children can find comforting. \u201cToo often, autistic children and their families are told that they are 'playing wrong,' but allowing kids to play in the way they choose can promote self-regulation and self-expression,\u201d explained Zoe Gross ASAN\u2019s Director of Advocacy. \u201cThis car can be played with in any configuration, and whether kids prefer to play pretend with it or just spin the wheels, the design emphasizes that there's no wrong way to play.\u201d The Flippin Fast comes on the heels of last year\u2019s Braille Twin Mill, the first Hot Wheels to have Braille dots molded into the car itself, as well as the plastic packaging. Furthermore, Mattel is working with ASAN to develop other products across its many toy brands that take children with autism into account. In 2022 they launched Bruno, a character with autism from the Thomas & Friends franchise. The Flippin Fast arrives just in time for Autism Awareness Month, which takes place in April. It can be found at most retailers nationwide for $1.25.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2024\/03\/31\/hot-wheels-creates-a-car-for-children-with-autism\/","title":"Hot Wheels creates a car for children with autism - Autoblog","sourceDomain":"autoblog.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":25},{"type":"PRAISE","count":4},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":7}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183072711399604224","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183072711399604224","reactionsCount":36,"commentsCount":3,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183072709788991488","message":{"attributes":[{"length":7,"start":73,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:mattel"}}},{"length":7,"start":81,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:autism"}}},{"length":5,"start":89,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:play"}}},{"length":5,"start":95,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:bcba"}}},{"length":4,"start":101,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:rbt"}}}],"text":"Love seeing this innovation!

Since January 2023, a total of 27 defendants have been charged and convicted for their participation in a sham to sell more than 7,600 fraudulent nursing documents from three now-shuttered schools in South Florida. Officials have estimated around 37% of individuals with phony documents passed the National Council Licensure Examination and went on to secure employment. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Gail Russ was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Ms. Russ was the director of student services and registrar at the now-closed Palm Beach School of Nursing. She was also ordered forfeiture of $861,672. Cassandre Jean and Vilaire Duroseau, two operators who recruited students, were also sentenced. Ms. Jean was sentenced to three years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and ordered forfeiture of more than $4.7 million. Mr. Duroseau was sentenced to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and ordered forfeiture of nearly $1.4 million. The three were also each ordered to pay a $20,000 fine. A federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in December found the three guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud charges after a three-week trial. The former president and owner of the Palm Beach School of Nursing, Johanah Napoleon, was the prosecution's main witness. Ms. Napoleon previously pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. At least seven people have now been sentenced in connection to the scheme.

I used personal money last week to make payroll,\" Chad Frank, DO, wrote on LinkedIn on March 20. Dr. Frank is the founder and president of the Non-Surgical Center for Physical and Sports Medicine in Plantation, Fla., which uses Change for billing processes. \"Out of desperation,\" Dr. Frank sent an email to Mr. Witty detailing his practice's situation, but expecting no response from the leader of the nation's largest healthcare organization still reeling from the most significant cyberattack in U.S. history. But a response from Mr. Witty came, along with assurance of a solution and a text shortly after from Optum Financial's COO, Jeff Meyerhofer. According to Dr. Frank, he was set up the same day with Optum Pay and then received an interest-free loan that is to be paid back 45 business days after Change's systems are fully restored. \"My business will survive and will thrive after this,\" he wrote. \"Behind the veil of a huge corporation lies two individuals at the top who sincerely cared for me.\" UnitedHealth Group has advanced more than $2 billion to providers and is launching software for medical claims preparation. The company has restored 99% of pharmacy network services. Change's electronic payments platform was restored March 15, with payer implementations underway. The latest connectivity updates are here. An American Hospital Association survey of nearly 1,000 hospitals conducted between March 9 and 12 found that 94% of hospitals have felt financial impact from the attack, and more than half have reported a \"significant or serious\" impact. Seventy-four percent of hospitals reported a direct effect on patient care. HHS has also called on UnitedHealth to \"take responsibility to ensure no provider is compromised by their cash flow challenges\" and to expedite the delivery of payments. The government urged the company to communicate about recovery efforts more frequently and with more transparency to both the healthcare system and state Medicaid agencies.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.beckershospitalreview.com\/cybersecurity\/how-unitedhealths-ceo-personally-supported-a-physician-following-cyberattack.html","title":"How UnitedHealth's CEO personally supported a physician following cyberattack","sourceDomain":"beckershospitalreview.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7177014121760993282","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7177014121760993282","reactionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7177014120536252418","message":{"attributes":[{"length":13,"start":155,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:88335147"}}},{"length":4,"start":263,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:aba"}}},{"length":7,"start":1102,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:autism"}}},{"length":8,"start":1235,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:bankers"}}},{"length":10,"start":1248,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:landlords"}}},{"length":4,"start":1340,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:aba"}}},{"length":7,"start":1362,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:bekind"}}},{"length":4,"start":1370,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:epp"}}},{"length":4,"start":1375,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:sba"}}},{"length":5,"start":1380,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:bcba"}}}],"text":"It's Friday and I appreciate a good story about the support of a physician's practice to maintain payroll in light of the Change Healthcare \"challenges.\"  John Jacobson and I hear from people weekly about the struggles that Change Healthcare has caused for their #ABA practice.
