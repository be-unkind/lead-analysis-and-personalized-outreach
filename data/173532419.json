A survey of S. abaster from the Tunis north lagoon (Tunisia), where the species occurs and breeds among vegetation, was conducted during 2007-2011, a multitude of anomalies were observed in external bodies and guts of some specimens of S.abaster and were suspected to be related to parasitic infections. The parasitic analysis were made in 2011 and revealed the presence of a number of visible cysts in the epidermis, musculature and intestine. A focussed histological study of the fish revealed the presence of microsporidian infections in the epidermis, musculature and the intestine. In addition, a coccidian infection of the intestine and a systemic digenean infection were noted. Pathology associated with the myotrophic microsporidian consisted mainly of pressure atrophy and disruption of affected muscles, whilst the gut-dwelling microsporidian infection may have affect absorption rates. Other infections were considered relatively benign. The results are discussed in relation to the general ecology of the host. In conclusion, it is suggested in this study to assess the health status of S. abaster in the lagoon using more data about the impact of such infections on the fish behaviour and to study the transmission of the parasites in this area to commercial fish.","publisher":"Journal of Environmental and Occupational Science 1: 99-104","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"year":2012},"description":"The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans.

One gyrodactylid, Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957, has been responsible for devastation of Altantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations in a number of Norwegian rivers. Current methods of eradicating G. salaris from river systems centre around the use of non-specific biocides, such as rotenone and aluminium sulphate.Although transmission routes in gyrodactylids have been studied extensively, the behaviour of individual parasites has received little attention. Specimens of Gyrodactylus gasterostei Glaser, 1974 and G. arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933, were collected from the skin of their host, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), and permitted to attach to the substrate. The movements of individual parasites were recorded and analysed.RESULTS:The behaviour patterns of the two species were similar and parasites were more active in red light and darkness than in white light. Four octopaminergic compounds were tested and all four inhibited the movements of parasites. Treatment ultimately led to death at low concentrations (0.2 muM), although prolonged exposure was necessary in some instances.CONCLUSIONS:Octopaminergic compounds may affect the parasite's ability to locate and remain on its host and these or related compounds might provide alternative or supplementary treatments for the control of G. salaris infections.

Its primary hosts, in which it undergoes a sexual phase, are phylactolaemate bryozoans. It develops in the bryozoan coelomic cavity as freely floating sacs which contain two types of cells, stellate cells and sporoplasmogenic cells, which become organised as spores. Eight stellate cells differentiate as four capsulogenic cells and four valve cells which surround a single sporoplasmogenic cell. The sporoplasmogenic cell undergoes meiosis and cytoplasmic fission to produce two sporoplasms with haploid nuclei. Sporoplasms contain secondary cells. The unusual development supports previously obtained data from 18S rDNA sequences, indicating that species of Tetracapsula form a clade. It diverged early in the evolution of the Myxozoa, before the radiation that gave rise to the better known genera belonging to the two orders in the single class Myxosporea. The genus Tetracapsula as seen in bryozoans shares some of the characters unique to the myxosporean phase and others typical of the actinosporean phase of genera belonging to the class Myxosporea. However, it exhibits other features which are not found in either phase. A new class Malacosporea and order Malacovalvulida are proposed to accommodate the family Saccosporidae and genus Tetracapsula. Special features of the new class are the sac-like proliferative body, valve cells not covering the exit point of the polar filament, lack of a stopper-like structure sealing the exit, maintenance of valve cell integrity even at spore maturity, absence of hardened spore walls and unique structure of sporoplasmosomes in the sporoplasms\n","publisher":"Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology 47(5), 456-468","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"name":"Susceptibility of a number of bivalve species to the protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae and their ability to act as vectors for this parasite.","publishedOn":{"year":1999},"description":"The protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae (Pichot et al., 1980) is a serious pathogen of the native European flat oyster Ostrea edulis.

This taxonomic information is progressively and systematically completed by species occurrence data, provided by literature, taxonomic and biogeographic databases, new data from CAML and other cruises, and museum collections. RAMS primary role was to establish a benchmark of the present taxonomic knowledge of the Southern Ocean biodiversity, particularly important in the context of the growing realization of potential impacts of the global change on Antarctic ecosystems. This, in turn, allowed detecting gaps in knowledge, taxonomic treatment and coverage, and estimating the importance of the taxonomic impediment, as well as the needs for more complete and efficient taxonomic tools.  The unknown part of the Southern Ocean biodiversity was approached by pointing out what remains to be explored and described in terms of geographical locations and bathymetric zones, habitats, or size classes of organisms. The growing importance of cryptic species is stressed, as they are more and more often detected by molecular studies in several taxa. Relying on RAMS results and on some case studies of particular model groups, the question of the potential number of species that remains to be discovered in the Southern Ocean is discussed.

All tissues can be infected, including the blood. Coelozoic species generally do not elicit significant host responses. Any developmental stages, however, where these migrate through the host tissues may produce a cellular response if resident for sufficient time. Histozoic parasites are generally more likely to evoke a pathological response since they are invariably in more intimate contact with immunocompetent host cells such as lymphocytes and phagocytes. In some cases, particularly with protistan infections, host response can be dramatic and cause significant disease due to organ dysfunction, with subsequent mortalities. Infections of the external epithelia caused by a variety of parasites including Monogenea and Copepoda are also significant, especially when large numbers are present. Resulting tissue necrosis compromises osmoregulation and facilitates entry of prokaryote infections. Parasites have numerous strategies to evade detection within the host, but even protected intracellular forms, e.g. microsporeans and muscle-invading myxozoans are recognized when they outgrow their accommodation or large cysts rupture, presenting parasite antigens to the host. In most instances, an evolutionary balance has been achieved between the host and the parasite and even when histopathology is evident, this is frequently localized and does not unduly impair performance of the affected organ. Examples include chronic inflammation, granuloma formation and focal fibrosis.

No external symptoms were noted, although infected animals were typically lethargic and unresponsive to external stimuli. Organs of infected animals were shrunken and collapsed compared with apparently healthy\nindividuals. Although the infection was systemic, marked host responses were only noted in the hepatopancreas where the parasite induced a pronounced haemocytic infi ltration. Prevalence of infection throughout the study was 1.1%, with a maximum monthly prevalence of 3%.The parasite is readily differentiated from the other described paramyxean species by a combination of the number of secondary and tertiary cells. In light of this new discovery, a revision of the order Paramyxida Chatton, 1911 is proposed based upon comparison to the original descriptions of this parasite group in various species of invertebrate hosts. The proposed classification is based on the number of cells within the spores (tertiary cells), so that only three genera remain within the order, namely Marteilia Grizel, Comps, Bonami, Cousserans, Duthoit et Le Pennec, 1974, Paramarteilia Ginsburger-Vogel et Desportes, 1979 and Paramyxa Chatton, 1911. Subsequent discrimination of species is based on a combination of the number of secondary cells within the primary cell and the number of tertiary cells within secondary cells. It is proposed that the genus Marteilioides Comps, Park et Desportes, 1986 is suppressed and the type species of the genus, M. chungmuensis Comps, Park et Desportes, 1986, is transferred to Marteilia and that the other representative of the genus, M. branchialis Anderson et Lester, 1992, is transferred to Paramarteilia.

First, the phenomenal increase in fin fish aquaculture in the 1990s has lead to the increased importance of these parasites; in turn this has lead to intensified research efforts, which have increased knowledge of the development, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of myxozoans. The\nhallmark discovery in the 1980s that the life cycle of Myxobolus cerebralis requires development of an actinosporean stage in the oligochaete, Tubifex tubifex, led to the elucidation of the life cycles of several other myxozoans. Also, the life cycle and taxonomy of the enigmatic PKX myxozoan has been resolved: it is the alternate stage of the unusual myxozoan, Tetracapsula bryosalmonae, from bryozoans. The 18S rDNA gene of many species has been sequenced, and here we add 22 new sequences to the data set. Ribosomal DNA sequences have also enabled development of diagnostic tests for myxozoans. PCR and in situ hybridisation tests based on rDNA sequences have been developed for Myxobolus cerebralis, Ceratomyxa shasta, Kudoa\nspp., and Tetracapsula bryosalmonae (PKX). Lectin-based and antibody tests have also been developed for certain myxozoans, such as PKX and C. shasta. We also review important diseases caused by myxozoans, which are emerging or re-emerging. Epizootics of whirling disease in wild rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have recently been reported throughout the Rocky Mountain states of the USA. With a dramatic increase in aquaculture of fishes using marine netpens, several marine myxozoans have been recognized or elevated in status as pathological agents. Kudoa thyrsites infections have caused severe post-harvest myoliquefaction in pen-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and Ceratomyxa spp., Sphaerospora spp., and Myxidium leei cause disease in pen-reared sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream species (family Sparidae) in Mediterranean countries.","publisher":"Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology 48(4), 395-413","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"name":"Mortality of captive Clupea harengus L.

Methods for\nthe discrimination of the species are reviewed as well as the approaches being taken to delineate different populations, which is crucial to appropriately manage individual fisheries. Cockle populations generally undergo sexual maturation during their second summer and sexes are separate. Eggs are pelagic, with larvae being both benthic and pelagic before settling on the\nsediment and becoming benthic adults. However, data are lacking on basic larval biology and dispersal mechanisms. Data are provided on predator-prey relationships including information on types of food of importance to cockles. Main predators of cockles include brown shrimp, shore crabs, gastropods, polychaetes, fish and a variety of birds and these can be important in structuring cockle populations. Predation of larval cockles by adult cockles through larviphagy can lead to reductions of up to 40% of the population.

ten-week feeding trial evaluated the feasibility of methanotroph (Methylococcus capsulatus) bacteria meal (FeedKind\u00ae, FK) as a fishmeal substitute in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) diets. Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets with different inclusion levels of FK (0 (fishmeal group), 43, 86, 129, 172 and 215 g\/kg) were formulated to replace 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 g\/kg fishmeal, respectively. The results showed that FK inclusion level could reach 129 g\/kg without significantly affecting growth or feed coefficient rate (P > 0.05), while growth performance was decreased and feed coefficient rate increased when FK inclusion levels exceeded 129 g\/kg (P < 0.05). Increase in FK inclusion levels tended to reduce plasma total cholesterol and total triglyceride whilst plasma total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in FK treatment groups were unchanged compared with fishmeal group (P > 0.05). FK inclusion levels at 43 g\/kg and 86 g\/kg were not detrimental to intestinal morphology whilst it was unfavourable when FK inclusion levels exceeded 86 g\/kg as the total length of intestinal wall thickness and villus height, villus height were obviously decreased compared with fishmeal group (P < 0.05). As regards to inflammatory cytokine genes, FK instead of fishmeal increased the expression levels of TLR2, RelA, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, 43 g\/kg and 86 g\/kg FK decreased the expression level of Caspase-3 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 129 g\/kg FK can replace 150 g\/kg fishmeal without negative effects on the growth performance, and replacing 100 g\/kg fishmeal with 86 g\/kg FK is more beneficial to intestinal health.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1050464822000705","name":"Effects of replacing fishmeal with methanotroph (Methylococcus capsulatus, Bath) bacteria meal (FeedKind\u00ae) on growth and intestinal health status of juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)","publisher":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology 122: 298-305","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"name":"Taxonomy, Anatomy, and Physiology","publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":1,"year":2022},"publisher":"Fundamentals of Aquatic Veterinary Medicine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":18,"year":2022},"description":"A 10-week growth study was conducted to replace soybean meal (SBM) with different levels of Methylococcus capsulatus (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%) on growth, digestibility, intestinal development and serum biochemical indices of juvenile Jian carp. The results showed that compared to the control group (0% M. capsulatus meal), 6%, 8%, and 10% M. capsulatus meal significantly improved the final average weight (FW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and decreased feed conversion rate (FCR). No significant difference was found in survival rate (SR) of treatment groups, and SR of each group was more than 95%. Jian carp had relatively high apparent digestibility (ADC) of diets containing M. capsulatus meal, the ADC of Jian carp for dry matter, crude protein, crude lipid, energy and amino acid of M. capsulatus meal was 70.85%, 90.68%, 67.68%, 80.82%, and 88.00-91.17%, respectively. Addition of M. capsulatus had no adverse effect in intestinal tissue of Jian carp juveniles, and 8% M. capsulatus meal significantly increased villus width compared with control group. Improved serum biochemical indices and increased antioxidant capacity of fish was noted in fish fed diets containing M. capsulatus meal. Replacement of M. capsulatus meal at the 6% level significantly decreased ALT activity compared to control group. The blood glucose (GLU) of all treatment groups had a decreasing trend, and the 8% and 10% M. capsulatus meal diets had significant effects on GLU content. Compared to the control group, 6%, 8%, and 10% M. capsulatus meal significantly decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) content. Compared to the control group, 6% and 8% M. capsulatus meal diets significantly increased serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of Jian carp, and 8% M. capsulatus meal diet significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) activity. The study has demonstrated that the replacement of SBM with M. capsulatus shows promise as an alternative protein source in the aquaculture industry.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0377840122000918?via%3Dihub","name":"Methanotroph (Methylococcus capsulatus, Bath) bacteria meal (FeedKind\u00ae) could effectively improve the growth, apparent digestibility coefficient, blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant indices of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

Seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were designed with 0%, 6.89%, 13.92%, 21.09%, 28.40%, 35.85%, and 43.46% MBP replacing FM, and fed to Pacific white shrimp (mean initial weight 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 g) for 8 weeks. The shrimp fed with 28.40%, 35.85%, and 43.46% MBP diets showed significantly higher weight gain and specific growth rate compared to the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05), while the other MBP diets had no significant effect on the growth performance (P\u2009>\u20090.05). No statistical differences were found in the activities of digestive enzymes in the stomach, hepatopancreas, and midgut among shrimp fed the dietary treatments (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Furthermore, antioxidant parameters in serum and hepatopancreas showed no significant differences among all the groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). In conclusion, it was revealed that MBP replacing from 28.40 to 43.46% FM in the diet with appropriate supplementation of essential amino acids significantly improved the growth of Pacific white shrimp without adverse effects on feed utilization, digestive enzyme activities, physiological condition, and antioxidant status. This study provides a reference for replacing FM with MBP in the diet of Pacific white shrimp.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10499-022-00869-9","name":"Evaluation of methanotroph (Methylococcus capsulatus, Bath) bacteria meal as an alternative protein source for growth performance, digestive enzymes, and health status of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)","publisher":"Aquaculture International","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":3,"year":2023},"description":"The impact of acclimation time and inclusion level of a bacterial protein (BP) meal on the digestibility of protein and amino acids to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was examined over five time points (3-days, 10-days, 17-days, 24-days, and 35-days) and five BP inclusion levels (0 g\/kg, 100 g\/kg, 200 g\/kg, 300 g\/kg and 400 g\/kg). An additional test diet with soy protein concentrate (300 g\/kg) was included as a comparison. Each of the diets were prepared from the same basal mash and using the same processing methods. Feed intake was measured daily. The results of the study showed that diet apparent digestibility coefficients (DADC) changed markedly over the time-course of the study, initially being low and variable before stabilizing at higher values from day-17 onwards. However, the effect on temporal variability of DADC values was consistent across all diets. This consistency translated to comparatively stable ingredient apparent digestibility coefficients (IADC) across each of the time points assessed, though there was a significant decline in all IADC values over time. Additionally, the IADC data was less reliable at the 10% inclusion level with higher variability and significantly differed from the other values determined at the higher inclusion levels. Furthermore, there was not always consistency in the IADC values for nitrogen and sum of amino acids, although both are often used as measures of protein. There were also significant differences among the different amino acids in terms of their IADC values. Although there was a trend towards poorer feed intake with the higher inclusion levels of the BP, this was no worse than that observed for the soy protein concentrate. In recognition of the findings of this study we are suggesting that digestibility studies with Atlantic salmon post-smolt should acclimate for a minimum of 14-days prior to faecal collection and that test ingredient inclusion should be 200 g\/kg or greater to obtain reliable data.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0044848622012546","name":"Digestibility of bacterial protein by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is affected by both inclusion level and acclimation time","publisher":"Aquaculture 565: 739137","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApX5QMBic1438cbacmcLcIbg4gPslGswJY,NAME_SEARCH,TARD)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1709565060000,"insightId":"6f86d7d5-8c4a-48bc-a51c-ee27dc4abf61","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5610AQEfdYmIpiHGNg\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1709565107383?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=I5ZWRE2SjaMXAHr4STXrke79qqpgAF7L2ZwSp6jwy0U","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5610AQEfdYmIpiHGNg\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1709565107383?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=I5ZWRE2SjaMXAHr4STXrke79qqpgAF7L2ZwSp6jwy0U"}]},"resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/app.ingo.me\/q\/phpdh","title":"Petfood Forum 2024"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":9}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7170435770338435073","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7170435770338435073","reactionsCount":9,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7170435768249700354","message":{"attributes":[{"start":136,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:petfood"}}},{"start":287,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gYH7Eg-y"}}},{"start":313,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:petfoodforum"}}},{"start":327,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:petfoodindustry"}}},{"start":344,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:petcare"}}},{"start":353,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:pethealth"}}},{"start":364,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:petbusiness"}}}],"text":"I just registered for Petfood Forum 2024, where a community of professionals from around the world come together to learn the latest in #petfood consumer trends and innovations, discover new tools for success and share ideas. \n\nWill you join me there?
