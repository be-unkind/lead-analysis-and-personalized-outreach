A polymeric nanobioconjugate drug based on biodegradable, nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic polymalic acid as a universal delivery nanoplatform was used for design and synthesis of nanomedicine drug for i.v. treatment of brain tumors. The polymeric drug passes through the BTB and tumor cell membrane using tandem monoclonal antibodies targeting the BTB and tumor cells. The next step for polymeric drug action was inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by specifically blocking the synthesis of a tumor neovascular trimer protein, laminin-411, by attached antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). The AONs were released into the target cell cytoplasm via pH-activated trileucine, an endosomal escape moiety. Drug delivery to the brain tumor and the release mechanism were both studied for this nanobiopolymer. Introduction of a trileucine endosome escape unit resulted in significantly increased AON delivery to tumor cells, inhibition of laminin-411 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, specific accumulation in brain tumors, and suppression of intracranial glioma growth compared with pH-independent leucine ester. The availability of a systemically active polymeric drug delivery system that passes through the BTB, targets tumor cells, and inhibits glioma growth gives hope for a successful strategy of glioma treatment.

Because nanoparticles can be engineered from components that (1) recognize disease at the cellular level, (2) are visible on imaging studies, and (3) deliver therapeutic compounds, nanotechnology is well suited for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases. Nanotechnology will enable earlier detection and treatment of diseases that are best treated in their initial stages, such as cancer. Advances in nanotechnology will also spur the discovery of new methods for delivery of therapeutic compounds, including genes and proteins, to diseased tissue. A myriad of nanostructured drugs with effective site-targeting can be developed by combining a diverse selection of targeting, diagnostic, and therapeutic components. Incorporating immune target specificity with nanostructures introduces a new type of treatment modality, nano-immunochemotherapy, for patients with cancer.

To address those concerns, membranolytic properties of various poly(\u03b2-L-malic acid) (PMLA) copolymers were extensively investigated as a function of concentration and pH. PMLA, a naturally occurring biodegradable polymer, acquires membranolytic activities after substitution of pendent carboxylates with hydrophobic amino acid derivatives. Ruled by hydrophobization and charge neutralization, membranolysis of PMLA copolymers increased as a function of polymer molecular weight and demonstrated a maximum with 50% substitution of carboxylates. Charge neutralization was achieved either conditionally by pH-dependent protonation or permanently by masking carboxylates. Membranolysis of PMLA copolymers containing tripeptides of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine were pH-dependent in contrast to pH-independent copolymers of Leucine ethyl ester and Leu-Leu-Leu-NH(2) with permanent charge neutralization. PMLA and tripeptides seemed a unique combination for pH-dependent membranolysis. In contrast to nontoxic pH-dependent PMLA copolymers, pH-independent copolymers were found toxic at high concentration, which is ascribed to their nonspecific disruption of plasma membrane at physiological pH. pH-Dependent copolymers were membranolytically active only at acidic pH typical of maturating endosomes, and are thus devoid of cytotoxicity.

However, because of their highly negative charge they pose problems for penetration through hydrophobic barriers such as membranes. We have engineered anionic polymalic acid (PMLA) to penetrate biological membranes. PMLA copolymers of leucine ethyl ester (P\/LOEt) or trileucine (P\/LLL) show either pH-independent or pH-dependent activity for membrane penetration. We report here for the first time on the mechanisms which are different for those two copolymers. Formation of hydrophobic patches in either copolymer is detected by fluorescence techniques. The copolymers display distinctly different properties in solution and during membranolysis. P\/LOEt copolymer binds to membrane as single molecules with high affinity, and induces leakage cooperatively through a mechanism known as \"carpet\" model, in which the polymer aligns at the surface throughout the entire process of membrane permeation. In contrast, P\/LLL self-assembles to form an oligomer of 105 nm in a pH-dependent manner (pKa 5.5) and induces membrane leakage through a two-phase process: the concentration dependent first-phase of insertion of the oligomer into membrane followed by a concentration independent second-phase of rearrangement of the membrane-oligomer complex. The insertion of P\/LLL is facilitated by hydrophobic interactions between trileucine side chains and lipids in the membrane core, resulting in transmembrane pores, through mechanism known as \"barrel-stave\" model. The understanding of the mechanism paves the way for future engineering of polymeric delivery systems with optimal cytoplasmic delivery efficiency and reduced systemic toxicity.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23063368","name":"Distinct mechanisms of membrane permeation induced by polymalic acid copolymers","publisher":"Biomaterials","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvqcUIBkGwaYaRoLRNiIOQ_Uc8OX5YXEJQ,NAME_SEARCH,fPZb)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2013},"description":"Poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) (PGGA) is an edible polypeptide excreted by certain bacteria that is presently accessible on a semi-industrial scale.
