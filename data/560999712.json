{"summary":"Dr Michael Grant MB BCh BAO BSc(Hons) MSc PGCert FHEA MRCP(UK)\n\nI completed my medical degree at Queens University Belfast alongside obtaining a 1st class Bachelor of Science degree in Molecular Oncology. During my undergraduate training, I accrued over 20 months of varied laboratory benchwork experience through competitive, funded studentships that resulted in numerous primary research presentations and publications. \n\nI secured my first-choice position in the highly competitive NHS Academic Foundation Programme (AFP) in London, working in Medical Oncology at Bart's Health NHS Trust. The focus of my training was cancer clinical trials at Barts Cancer Institute, under the supervision of Professor Thomas Powles (\u201cNature\u2019s 10\u201d, 2023). I was an investigator on commercial and investigator-led trials, and worked on a range of academic projects in immuno-oncology. I continued this work in a clinical research fellowship with Prof Powles, conducting translational research and clinical development across a range of trials in different cancer indications - alongside obtaining a PGCert in teaching and an honorary appointment as an lecturer in oncology. Towards the end of my fellowship, I was headhunted for a clinical development medical director role in a Francis Crick Institute\/CRUK biotech developing first-in-human, advanced therapeutics for solid tumours. \n\nSince transitioning to industry, I have gained extensive clinical development experience across a range of therapeutic agents (including compounds that have gained \u2018Breakthrough Therapy\u2019 and \u2018Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway\u2019 designations) with a particular focus on immuno-oncology therapies. Undertaking roles in biotechs - occasionally as the only in-house physician - has cultivated a broad and adaptive skillset, and allowed me to build on my experiences as a clinician scientist. With experience leading international trials in solid and haematological cancers (Phase I to III), I have been responsible for trial design, producing key study documents, successful regulatory submissions\/responses, statistical and translational analysis, pharmacovigilance, clinical strategy, and have served as medical monitor for pivotal studies.\n\nWhilst working in industry, I have continued to practice clinically in NHS oncology services and hold academic positions. I have completed my Royal College of Physicians membership examinations (MRCP), secured a position in the pharmaceutical medicine higher speciality training (PMST) programme, and have completed a Masters in Experimental Therapeutics at the University of Oxford.","pastPositions":[{"endedOn":{"month":5,"year":2023},"companyName":"ADC Therapeutics","title":"Director, Clinical Development Physician ","companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:8297253","posId":1,"current":true,"startedOn":{"month":9,"year":2022}}],"lastName":"Grant","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:560999712","geoRegion":"London, England, United Kingdom","fullName":"Michael Grant","firstName":"Michael","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Infinitopes","description":"Leading clinical development for the early phase, precision immunomics platform at Infinitopes; a Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and University of Oxford spin-out, empowering the immune system to fight cancer metastases with unique, de novo antigen discovery technologies, innovative high efficiency vectors, and intelligent clinical trial design.","title":"Executive Medical Director","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"11-50","headquarters":{"geographicArea":"Oxfordshire","country":"United Kingdom","city":"Oxford","postalCode":"OX3 7FZ","line2":"20.06 BioEscalator Innovation Building","line1":"696 Roosevelt Drive"},"flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/infinitopes\/","industry":"Biotechnology Research"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:80529294","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1,"numMonths":1},"startedOn":{"month":5,"year":2023}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACFwLSAB6rEou8IqvFSUjyEsWYTNzxv8Qqo,NAME_SEARCH,gv69)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1672936480585?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=MjRFH0W3FDD6gviAPnpD09qMDjrQpymf-h4XruGKC2k","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1672936480585?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=UtlUgabcXf4W4j8-8MWkxfmNuzYAdZdkOrVArhwcoE8","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1672936480585?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=-ZOLjJmZtzetcVnVtI7sEQ3JyXv6vn0HdAlGtFW3GjM","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1672936480585?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=oJ8NxW6uwZgx8EUD2zEGP5Sb14475244y8NSa5AD0kA","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5603AQEPMYZRb0o7gA\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[],"contactInfo":{"socialHandles":[{"type":"TWITTER","name":"mickgrant","dataSource":"LINKEDIN"}]},"industry":"Biotechnology Research","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2023},"degree":"Master of Science -

Participating clinicians included all levels of trainees and ED physicians. Questionnaires were distributed during weekly ED educational sessions, followed by training on immune-mediated toxicities.\n\nResults: Between March 2019 and September 2019, the questionnaire was delivered to 126 participants (80% junior grade, 20% specialist ED consultants). There was no significant association between clinician's seniority and overall score reached on the questionnaire. Amongst all participants, 56, 49, and 36% identified correctly ICIs as the first-line treatment regimen for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, respectively. Overall, 90% of the participants recognized correctly cisplatin as a chemotherapy agent and 77% pembrolizumab as an ICI agent. Generally, there was a good understanding of chemotherapy related toxicities, however, the participants scored less well on questions relating to ICIs. Ten months following the initial audit and educational intervention, a single site re-audit was performed. The total average correct score was similar pre- and post-intervention (8, 13%, respectively). Conclusions: Management of immune mediated toxicities is inferior compared to chemotherapy across physicians working in major ED departments in London.

We compared outcomes (observed response rate [ORR], progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) between patients with vs without prior RS, and by type of prior locoregional treatment (RS vs RT vs no locoregional treatment). Patients with de novo advanced disease were excluded. Analysis was stratified by treatment line (first-line and second-line or greater [second-plus line]). Logistic regression was used to compare ORR, while Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and Cox regression were used for PFS and OS. Multivariable models were adjusted for known prognostic factors.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 562 patients (first-line: 342 and second-plus line: 220). There was no difference in outcomes based on prior locoregional treatment among those treated with first-line ICIs. In the second-plus-line setting, prior RS was associated with higher ORR (adjusted odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.19\u20135.74]), longer OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.42\u20130.88) and PFS (aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45\u20130.89) vs no prior RS.

This study provides important preliminary data that prior intravesical BCG exposure may not impact ICI efficacy in aUC.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1558767321002421#!","name":"Response and outcomes to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced urothelial cancer based on prior intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin","publisher":"Clinical Genitourinary Cancer","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACFwLSAB6rEou8IqvFSUjyEsWYTNzxv8Qqo,NAME_SEARCH,gv69)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":3,"year":2022},"description":"Following CARMENA and SURTIME, patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate and poor risk receive systemic therapy with the primary tumour (primary) in place, with the option of deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in responding patients. We retrospectively analysed the safety and efficacy of first-line nivolumab\/ipilimumab in 71 primary mRCC patients (42.3% IMDC poor risk; 43.6% with more than three metastatic sites). The baseline mean primary diameter was 9.3 cm and median follow-up was 11.5 mo. Of 69 patients with at least one follow-up computed tomography scan, 23 (33.3 %) had a partial response (PR) of the primary after a median of 4.8 mo, which was associated with a 91.3% overall response rate at metastatic sites (MSs) and absence of progressive disease, irrespective of the IMDC risk. The complete response (CR) rate at MSs (n = 7 [10.1%]) is similar to the CR rate in CheckMate 214. Thirteen deferred CNs were performed (18.8%) after a median of 13 mo, rendering four patients disease free. Only 4.3% of primaries progressed; grade 3\u20134 immune-related adverse events occurred in 31.9%. Irrespective of the IMDC risk, patients with a PR in the primary had a 1-yr overall survival rate of 89% versus 67% in those without (p = 0.012).","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2666168321033802","name":"Primary Renal Tumour Response in Patients Treated with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Real-world Data Assessment","publisher":"European Urology Open Science","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACFwLSAB6rEou8IqvFSUjyEsWYTNzxv8Qqo,NAME_SEARCH,gv69)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":2,"year":2024},"description":"Cancer is a global health challenge, with changing demographics and lifestyle factors producing an increasing burden worldwide.
