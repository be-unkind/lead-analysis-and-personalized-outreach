{"summary":"Dreams are to fly not to dry!\nSelf-employed pharmacist, PhD, postdoc, 6 years in academia, and 2 years in department management qualified me as educator, researcher and manager.\nAt the age of 22, I started my career by establishing and managing my own pharmacy. However, my dream of getting PhD from Germany kept chasing me till it became true.\nDuring my PhD, I have explored 4 major fields, or as I call them my 4Ps, pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and preclinical studies. I have established a novel peptide synthesis strategy for peptide-based drug delivery system. Moreover, I have been engaged in working with radioactive experiments, i.e. working with one of the highest controlled safety policies. That would not have been possible without the great environment in our lab. In 2011, I earned my PhD \u201cmagna cum laude\u201d.\nMy next station has been as assistant professor at Faculty of Pharmacy, Syria. For me, overcoming the current crisis there needs urgent thinking out-of-the-box; i.e. not only refresh the existing modules, but even to develop and establish new ones. For the 1st time in Syria, pharmacy students were given the chance to practice the \u201ccomputer-aided drug design\u201d under my supervision of their graduation projects. The success of these projects sparked the department to give a green light for establishing related Master Degree.\nMy idle time was dedicated to my share of the translation of \u201cAn Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry, 5th Ed, G. L. Patrick\u201d.\nMoreover, I have been appointed as Head of Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department. Being in charge of 5 major labs, more than 500 students, 25 assistants, 5 technicians, and 5 academic staff members, gave me a priceless experience in multi-tasking and in managing several projects simultaneously. The position and its responsibilities shaped my skills and provided me with solid leadership and management knowledge.\nI have 5 key publications with total of \u224822 impact points and over 200 citations!","lastName":"Sarko","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:377146764","geoRegion":"Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany","fullName":"Dikran Sarko","firstName":"Dikran","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Topas

Especially for therapeutics with high molecular weight, strategies are required to enable delivery to intracellular targets. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) represent a powerful tool to mediate the entry of large cargos such as proteins, siRNA and nanoparticles. The high diversity of CPPs is the prerequisite to use this class of carriers for various applications. However, therapies based on CPPs are hampered by their unfavorable pharmacokinetics, mainly dominated by their rapid renal clearance and their lack of specificity. Rational design is required to overcome these disadvantages and thereby exploits the actual potential of CPPs. We summarize and highlight the current state of knowledge with special emphasis on pharmacokinetics. The unclear internalization pathways of CPPs remain one of the main obstacles and therefore have been in the focus of research. In this review, several promising strategies such as the combination with targeting sequences, activatable CPPs and adjustment of the molecular weight are described. In addition, new absorption pathways such as nasal, pulmonary or transdermal uptake expand the applicability of CPPs and may be a promising prospect for clinical application.","publisher":"Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25312539","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABZ6zYwBvE_cDVOXrfz6mgR1n9LffcAYzlw,NAME_SEARCH,W5Ju)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":2,"year":2013},"description":"Site-specific enzymatic reactions with microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) lead to a homogenous species of immunoconjugates with a defined ligand\/antibody ratio. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of different numbers of DOTA chelats coupled to a decalysine backbone on the in vivo behavior of the chimeric monoclonal anti-L1CAM antibody chCE7agl. The enzymatic conjugation of (DOTA)1-decalysine, (DOTA)3-decalysine or (DOTA)5-decalysine to the antibody heavy chain (via Gln295\/297) gave rise to immunoconjugates containing two, six or ten DOTA moieties respectively. Radiolabeling of the immunoconjugates with 177Lu yielded specific activities of approximately 70 MBq\/mg, 400 MBq\/mg and 700 MBq\/mg with increasing numbers of DOTA chelates. Biodistribution experiments in SKOV3ip human ovarian cancer cell xenografts demonstrated a high and specific accumulation of radioactivity at the tumor site for all antibody derivatives with a maximal tumor accumulation of 43.6\u00b14.3% ID\/g at 24 h for chCE7agl-[(DOTA)-decalysine]2, 30.6\u00b112.0% ID\/g at 24 h for chCE7agl-[(DOTA)3-decalysine]2 and 49.9\u00b13.1% ID\/g at 48 h for chCE7agl-[(DOTA)5-decalysine)]2. The rapid elimination from the blood of chCE7agl-[(DOTA)-decalysine]2 (1.0\u00b10.1% ID\/g at 24 h) is associated with a high liver accumulation (23.2\u00b14.6% ID\/g at 24 h). This behavior changed depending on the numbers of DOTA moieties coupled to the decalysine peptide with a slower blood clearance (5.1\u00b11.0 (DOTA)3 versus 11.7\u00b11.4% ID\/g (DOTA)5, p<0.005 at 24 h) and lower radioactivity levels in the liver (21.4\u00b13.4 (DOTA)3 versus 5.8\u00b10.7 (DOTA)5, p<0.005 at 24 h). We conclude that the site-specific and stoichiometric uniform conjugation of the highly DOTA-substituted decalysine ((DOTA)5-decalysine) to an anti-tumor antibody leads to the formation of immunoconjugates with high specific activity and excellent in vivo behavior and is a valuable option for radioimmunotherapy and potentially antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).","url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0060350#pone-0060350-g004","name":"DOTA-Functionalized Polylysine: A High Number of DOTA Chelates Positively Influences the Biodistribution of Enzymatic Conjugated Anti-Tumor Antibody chCE7agl","publisher":"PLoS ONE","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABZ6zYwBvE_cDVOXrfz6mgR1n9LffcAYzlw,NAME_SEARCH,W5Ju)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":1,"year":2012},"description":"Radiopharmaceuticals constitute diagnostic and therapeutic tools for both clinical and preclinical applications. They are a blend of a tracer moiety that mediates a site specific accumulation and an effector: a radioisotope whose decay enables either molecular imaging or exhibits cytotoxic effects. Radioactive halogens and lanthanides are the most commonly used isotopes for radiopharmaceuticals. Due to their ready availability and the facile labeling metallic radionuclides offer ideal characteristics for applications in nuclear medicine. A stable link between the radionuclide and the carrier molecule is the primary prerequisite for in vivo applications. The radionuclide is selected according to its physical and chemical properties i.e. half-life, the type of decay, the energy emitted and its availability. Bifunctional chelating agents are used to stably link the radiometal to the carrier moiety of the radiopharmaceutical. The design of the bifunctional chelator has to consider the impact of the radiometal chelate on the biological properties of the target-specific pharmaceutical. Here, with an emphasis on oncology, we review applications of radiopharmaceuticals that contain bifunctional chelators, while highlighting successes and identifying the key challenges that need to be addressed for the successful translation of target binding molecules into tracers for molecular imaging and endoradiotherapy.","url":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/ben\/cmc\/2012\/00000019\/00000017\/art00002","name":"Bifunctional Chelators in the Design and Application of Radiopharmaceuticals for Oncological Diseases","publisher":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABZ6zYwBvE_cDVOXrfz6mgR1n9LffcAYzlw,NAME_SEARCH,W5Ju)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":7,"year":2010},"description":"Many delivery approaches have been developed to use CPPs as tools for drug delivery. However, until now a systematic analysis of their in vivo properties including potential tumor binding specificity for drug targeting purposes has not been conducted. Ten of the most commonly applied CPPs were synthesized and labeled. Uptake studies were conducted using a panel of six tumor cell lines of different origin. The stability of the peptides was examined in human serum. Biodistribution experiments were conducted in nude mice bearing human prostate carcinoma. Finally, PET measurements were performed in Wistar rats. The in vitro uptake studies revealed high cellular uptake values, but no specificity toward any of the cell lines. The biodistribution in tumor-bearing nude mice showed a high transient accumulation in well-perfused organs and a rapid clearance from the blood. All of the CPPs revealed a relatively low accumulation rate in the brain. The highest uptake values were observed in the liver (maximal uptake of 51 %ID\/g observed for oligoarginine (R9)) and the kidneys (maximal uptake of 94 %ID\/g observed for NLS). The uptake values in the PC-3 tumor were low at all time points, indicating a lack of tumor specific accumulation for all peptides studied. A micro-PET imaging study with 68Ga-labeled penetratin, Tat and TP10 confirmed the organ distribution data. These data reveal that CPPs do not show evidence for application in tumor targeting purposes in vivo. However, CPPs readily penetrate into most organs and show rapid clearance from the circulation. The high uptake rates observed in vitro and the relatively low specificity in vivo imply that CPPs would be better suited for topical application in combination with cargoes which show passive targeting and dominate the pharmacokinetic behavior. In conclusion, CPPs are suitable as drug carriers for in vivo application provided that their pharmacokinetic properties are also considered in design of CPP drug delivery systems.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/mp100223d","name":"The Pharmacokinetics of Cell-Penetrating Peptides","publisher":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABZ6zYwBvE_cDVOXrfz6mgR1n9LffcAYzlw,NAME_SEARCH,W5Ju)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":5,"year":2016},"description":"Kidneys are involved in essential complex procedures that maintain the body in\nequilibrium and preservethe interior environment necessary for life.
