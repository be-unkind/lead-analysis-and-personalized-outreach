signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), at different dose levels with filtered-back-projection (FBP), iterative reconstruction (IR), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) alone and in combination with orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR) in a total hip arthroplasty (THA) phantom.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nScans were acquired from high- to low-dose (CTDIvol: 40.0, 32.0, 24.0, 16.0, 8.0, and 4.0 mGy) at 120- and 140- kVp. Images were reconstructed using FBP, IR (iDose4 level 2, 4, and 6) and MBIR (IMR, level 1, 2, and 3) with and without O-MAR. CT number accuracy in Hounsfield Units (HU), noise or standard deviation, SNRs, and CNRs were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe IMR technique showed lower noise levels (p\u2009<\u20090.01), higher SNRs (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and CNRs (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with FBP and iDose4 in all acquisitions from high- to low-dose with constant CT numbers. O-MAR reduced noise (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and improved SNRs (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and CNRs (p\u2009<\u20090.001) while improving CT number accuracy only at a low dose. At the low dose of 4.0 mGy, IMR level 1, 2, and 3 showed 83%, 89%, and 95% lower noise values, a factor 6.0, 9.2, and 17.9 higher SNRs, and 5.7, 8.8, and 18.2 higher CNRs compared with FBP respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBased on quantitative analysis of CT number accuracy, noise values, SNRs, and CNRs, we conclude that the combined use of IMR and O-MAR enables a reduction in radiation dose of 83% compared with FBP and iDose4 in the CT imaging of a THA phantom.","url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00256-017-2580-2","name":"Low-dose CT imaging of a total hip arthroplasty phantom using model-based iterative reconstruction and orthopedic metal artifact reduction.","publisher":"Skeletal Radiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABIHvVIB-72MYO9fqk3UeK6esXOUax1_2Qc,NAME_SEARCH,iene)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHmdRUB5odmLVnXVAHXQoYYtiakjpRMMlA,NAME_SEARCH,f6Xl)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlnzMcBwvDx13pbnS5NXzlnUmRvW-RfRT8,NAME_SEARCH,qU2j)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHuqpMBt2HUp6tgjYNpyu0lel3SdXTsD6o,NAME_SEARCH,sh6d)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAS2-uUBB6JOzERhRyiFHAA6-dhK9QRqN0Y,NAME_SEARCH,UqO1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABTeCj8B2oU_MW5Y4ZUN0dRElv5NAeFxvus,NAME_SEARCH,1Ge5)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQKjHcBCrp6bwm61t8bqVryOys7YJ3H_ac,NAME_SEARCH,jWVw)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":14,"year":2017},"description":"Purpose:\n\nTo quantify the impact of prosthesis material and design on the reduction of metal artefacts in total hip arthroplasties using virtual monochromatic dual-layer detector Spectral CT imaging.\n\nRESULTS:\nIn 70 and 74keV virtual monochromatic images the CT numbers of the pellets were similar to 120-kVp and 140-kVp polychromatic results, therefore serving as reference. A separation into three categories of metal artefacts was made (no, mild\/moderate and severe) where pellets were categorized based on HU deviations. At high keV values overall image contrast was reduced. For mild\/moderate artefacts, the highest average CNRs were attained with virtual monochromatic 130keV images, acquired at 140-kVp. Severe metal artefacts were not reduced. In 130keV images, only mild\/moderate metal artefacts were significantly reduced compared to 70 and 74keV images. Deviations in CT numbers, noise, SNRs and CNRs due to metal artefacts were decreased with respectively 64%, 57%, 62% and 63% (p<0.001) compared to unaffected pellets. Optimal keVs, based on CNRs, for different unilateral and bilateral metal hip prostheses consisting of different metal alloys varied from 74 to 150keV. The Titanium alloy resulted in less severe artefacts and were reduced more effectively compared to the Cobalt alloy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nVirtual monochromatic dual-layer Spectral CT imaging results in a significant reduction of streak artefacts produced by beam-hardening in mild and moderate artefacts by improving CT number accuracy, SNRs and CNRs, while decreasing noise values in a total hip arthroplasty phantom. An optimal monochromatic energy of 130keV was found ranging from 74keV to 150keV for different unilateral and bilateral hip prostheses consisting of different metal alloys.","url":"http:\/\/www.ejradiology.com\/article\/S0720-048X(17)30002-5\/abstract","name":"Quantifying metal artefact reduction using virtual monochromatic dual-layer detector spectral CT imaging in unilateral and bilateral total hip prostheses.","publisher":"European Journal of Radiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABIHvVIB-72MYO9fqk3UeK6esXOUax1_2Qc,NAME_SEARCH,iene)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHmdRUB5odmLVnXVAHXQoYYtiakjpRMMlA,NAME_SEARCH,f6Xl)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlnzMcBwvDx13pbnS5NXzlnUmRvW-RfRT8,NAME_SEARCH,qU2j)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHuqpMBt2HUp6tgjYNpyu0lel3SdXTsD6o,NAME_SEARCH,sh6d)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAS2-uUBB6JOzERhRyiFHAA6-dhK9QRqN0Y,NAME_SEARCH,UqO1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABTeCj8B2oU_MW5Y4ZUN0dRElv5NAeFxvus,NAME_SEARCH,1Ge5)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQKjHcBCrp6bwm61t8bqVryOys7YJ3H_ac,NAME_SEARCH,jWVw)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":1,"year":2017},"description":"Aims\nThe aim of this study was to compare the Push Ortho Thumb Brace CMC and a custom- made orthosis in the treatment of patients with primary osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.

Of these, 59 patients with a mean age of 60.1 years (standard deviation 8.2), completed the study. Patients used both orthoses for two weeks with a two-week washout period in- between. Pain was measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Hand function was assessed using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function test, Nine Hole Peg Test, key grip, pinch grip and Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis. Patient preference was assessed using the Dutch version of the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology score.\n\nResults\nBoth orthoses resulted in a minor reduction in pain scores without significant difference between the two orthoses. The Push Ortho Thumb Brace CMC interfered less with key grip (p < 0.001) and the Nine Hole Peg Test (p < 0.001) than the custom-made orthosis.

We aim to prospectively determine the diagnostic performance of combined FCH PET and MRI for lymph node staging. \nMethods: \nThis was a single site study of diagnostic accuracy in a well-defined group of 21 consecutive high-risk prima- ry prostate cancer patients (>30% chance of lymph node metastases) in a large community hos- pital. We performed FCH PET\/CT and MRI with DW-MRI prior to endoscopic extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND). PET was fused and interpreted together with various MRI image sets (T1, T2, DWIBS) and was only scored positive when a lymph node seen on MRI coincided with increased focal FCH uptake on PET. Findings were compared with detailed histological evaluation, on a per-patient and per-region level. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of combined PET-MRI. Results: 14 out of 21 patients had metastatic lymph nodes with 37 out of 164 evaluable regions harboring metastases. On a per-patient analysis, PET-MRI had a sensitivity\/specificity of 79\/100% with a PPV\/NPV of 100\/77%. On a per-region analysis (n = 164) these figure were 65\/99% and 96\/91%, respectively. \nConclusions: \nCombined DW-MRI and FCH PET\/CT has a very high positive predictive value in high risk prostate cancer patients.

The O-MAR algorithm deploys an iterative loop where the metal sinogram is identified, extracted, and subsequently serves as a mask to correct the measured sinogram. Main goal of this study is to quantify the ability of the O-MAR technique to correct deviation in medullary bone attenuation caused by streak artefacts from the large-head MoM THA embedded in a phantom. Secondary goal is to evaluate the influence of O-MAR on CNR.\nMethods\nThe phantom was designed as a Perspex box (PMMA) containing water and a supplementary MOM THA surrounded by Perspex columns comprising calibrated calcium pellets. Scans were obtained with and without a MoM THA at different dose levels. Different reconstructions were made.  Information about the attenuation in Hounsfield units, image noise in standard deviation within the ROI\u2019s were extracted and the CNR was calculated.\nResults\nPellet L0 and R0 (proximal of the MoM THA) were defined as reference, lacking any disturbance by metal artefacts; L5, L6 and L8 were respectively visually categorized as \u2018light\u2019 \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018heavy disturbance\u2019. Significant improvements in attenuation deviation caused by metal artefact were 43, 68 and 32 %, for respectively pellet L5, L6 and L8 (p < 0.001). Significant CNR improvements were present for L5 and L6 and were respectively 72 and 52 % (p < 0.001). O-MAR showed no improvement on CNR for L8.\nConclusion\nThis phantom study significantly increases image quality by the use of O-MAR in the presence of metal artefacts by significantly reducing metal artefacts subsequently and increasing CNR on a 64 slice CT system in light and medium disturbance of the image.\n\n","url":"http:\/\/springerplus.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40064-016-2006-y","name":"Quantitative analysis of orthopedic metal artefact reduction in 64-slice computed tomography scans in large head metal-on-metal total hip replacement, a phantom study","publisher":"Springer Open","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABMwU_oBU3ccJlh9S8MUeDCG0wpf6uWaCJQ,NAME_SEARCH,Bpq2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAS2-uUBB6JOzERhRyiFHAA6-dhK9QRqN0Y,NAME_SEARCH,UqO1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAP_Y5gBioYwvKTXM6QeK0OBJ_G2uFAj6po,NAME_SEARCH,cNXm)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXwgEwBSabJrJQc7wTUx88Qq-AzRc9ZaIA,NAME_SEARCH,MXgx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQKjHcBCrp6bwm61t8bqVryOys7YJ3H_ac,NAME_SEARCH,jWVw)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":21,"year":2016},"description":"Purpose: \nTo explore ipsilateral and contralateral acetabular roof bone stock density in unilateral large head MoM THA whether there is a significant lower acetabular bone stock in the hip with a metal-on- metal (MoM) total hip replacement compared to the contralateral side. Second part of this study is to examine if there are any associates with regard to potential bone stock density difference.\nMaterials & methods: \nA database of 317 patients with unilateral metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip replace- ments was set up retrospectively. On computed tomography scans, conducted after a relative short in situ time period averaging 2.8 years, regions-of-interests were drawn in the trabecular bone of the acetabulum to measure average Hounsfield Units (HU). HU differences were calculated and tested by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Univariate analysis was conducted to examine associates of potential bone loss.\nResults: \nIn a population of 317 patients (156 male, 161 female) with an average age of 61.9 \u00b1 7.8, the median HU on the side of the MoM replacement was 123.3 (7.6\u2013375.4). On the contralateral side, median HU was 144.7 (\u22120.4 to 332.8). The median HU difference was 21.4 after a mean post-operative in situ time of 2.8 years. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test proved a significant difference (p < 0.001). Univariate analyses show that the in situ time of the MoM THA has a significant correlation with the bone density difference.\nConclusion: \nResults show a significant lower bone density at the acetabular roof at the side of the prosthesis compared with the contralateral side after short in situ time of the MoM THA in patients with unilateral MoM total hip replacements. In our patient population, the in situ time showed a significant association with the acetabular bone density difference. As acetabular roof bone stock measurements are feasible and show temporal decline this could become an important parameter to be used in orthopedic decision making for revision surgery.","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejrad.2016.01.019","name":"CT-based quantification of bone stock in large head metal-on-metal unilateral total hip replacements","publisher":"European Journal of Radiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAj4bvMBPOdz9x6w5lbrg9kk7jVG_NiSIPM,NAME_SEARCH,WB3t)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGVmfwB1pUKTLuHTDQWL4jkvpigBH8AfuU,NAME_SEARCH,NdbH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAU5NbsBoNwyVhi-GzrjYnJkH_TsOxT_bhA, , )"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAkP-JsBpSyOPYZf5HYusAWImQoD_UL0IKw,NAME_SEARCH,Wm5L)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXwgEwBSabJrJQc7wTUx88Qq-AzRc9ZaIA,NAME_SEARCH,MXgx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAS2-uUBB6JOzERhRyiFHAA6-dhK9QRqN0Y,NAME_SEARCH,UqO1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQKjHcBCrp6bwm61t8bqVryOys7YJ3H_ac,NAME_SEARCH,jWVw)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":7,"year":2015},"description":"Abstract\nWe compared the incidence of pseudotumours after large head metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) with that after conventional metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA and assessed the predisposing factors to pseudotumour formation. From a previous randomised controlled trial which compared large head (38 mm to 60 mm) cementless MoM THA with conventional head (28 mm) cementless MoP THA, 93 patients (96 THAs: 41 MoM (21 males, 20 females, mean age of 64 years, standard deviation (sd) 4) and 55 MoP (25 males, 30 females, mean age of 65 years, sd 5) were recruited after a mean follow-up of 50 months (36 to 64). The incidence of pseudotumours, measured using a standardised CT protocol was 22 (53.7%) after MoM THA and 12 (21.8%) after MoP THA. Women with a MoM THA were more likely to develop a pseudotumour than those with a MoP THA (15 vs 7, odds ratio (OR) = 13.4, p < 0.001). There was a similar incidence of pseudotumours in men with MoM THAs and those with MoP THAs (7 vs 5, OR = 2.1, p = 0.30). Elevated cobalt levels (\u2265 5 microgram\/L) were only associated with pseudotumours in women with a MoM THA. There was no difference in mean Oxford and Harris hip scores between patients with a pseudotumour and those without. Contrary to popular belief, pseudotumours occur frequently around MoP THAs. Women with a MoM THA and an elevated cobalt level are at greatest risk. In this study, pseudotumours had no effect on the functional outcome after either large head MoM or conventional MoP THA.

By using a phantomless internal reference standard, Hounsfield unit (HU) measurements of various tissues can potentially be assessed in patients with a CT scan of the pelvis without an added phantom at time of CT acquisition. This paves the way for development of a tool for quantification of the change in tissue density in one patient over time and between patients. This could make every CT scan made without contrast available for research purposes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nFifty patients with unilateral metal-on-metal total hip replacements, scanned together with a calibration reference phantom used in bone mineral density measurements, were included in this study. On computed tomography scans of the pelvis without the use of intravenous iodine contrast, reference values for fat and muscle were measured in the phantom as well as within the patient's body. The conformity between the references was examined with the intra-class correlation coefficient.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean HU (\u00b1 SD) of reference values for fat for the internal- and phantom references were -91.5 (\u00b17.0) and -90.9 (\u00b17.8), respectively. For muscle, the mean HU (\u00b1 SD) for the internal- and phantom references were 59.2 (\u00b16.2) and 60.0 (\u00b17.2), respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficients for fat and muscle were 0.90 and 0.84 respectively and show excellent agreement between the phantom and internal references.\nCONCLUSION:\nInternal references can be used with similar accuracy as references from an external phantom.

The objective of this study was to identify the true incidence and risk factors of pseudotumor formation in large head metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasties.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nIncidence, time course and risk factors for pseudotumor formation were analysed after large femoral head MoM-THA. We defined a pseudotumor as a (semi-)solid or cystic peri-prosthetic soft-tissue mass with a diameter \u22652 cm that could not be attributed to infection, malignancy, bursa or scar tissue. All patients treated in our clinic with MoM-THA's were contacted. CT scan, metal ions and X-rays were obtained. Symptoms were recorded.\nRESULTS:\nAfter median follow-up of 3 years, 706 hips were screened in 626 patients. There were 228 pseudotumors (32.3 %) in 219 patients (35.0 %). Pseudotumor formation significantly increased after prolonged follow-up. Seventy-six hips (10.8 %) were revised in 73 patients (11.7 %), independent risk factors were identified. Best cutoff point for cobalt and chromium was 4 \u03bcg\/l (68 and 77 nmol\/l).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study confirms a high incidence of pseudotumors, dramatically increasing after prolonged follow-up. Risk factors for pseudotumors are of limited importance. Pain was the strongest predictor for pseudotumor presence; cobalt chromium and swelling were considered poor predictors.

Patients received one craniocaudal (CC) and one mediolateral oblique (MLO) compression for both breasts.

At reduced dose, filtered back projection (FBP) results in an overestimation of the amount of emphysema due to higher noise levels, while the use of iterative reconstruction (IR) can result in an underestimation due to reduced noise. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of dose reduction and hybrid IR (HIR) or model-based IR (MIR) on CT emphysema quantification.\n\nMethods\n\nTwenty-two patients underwent inspiratory chest CT scan at routine radiation dose and at 45%, 60% and 75% reduced radiation dose. Acquisitions were reconstructed with FBP, HIR and MIR. Emphysema was quantified using the 15th percentile of the attenuation curve and the percentage of voxels below -950 HU. To determine whether the use of a different percentile or HU threshold is more accurate at reduced dose levels and with IR, additional measurements were performed using different percentiles and HU thresholds to determine the optimal combination.\n\nResults\n\nDose reduction resulted in a significant overestimation of emphysema, while HIR and MIR resulted in an underestimation. Lower HU thresholds with FBP at reduced dose and higher HU thresholds with HIR and MIR resulted in emphysema percentages comparable to the reference. The 15th percentile quantification method showed similar results as the HU threshold method.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis within-patients study showed that CT emphysema quantification is significantly affected by dose reduction and IR. This can potentially be solved by adapting commonly used thresholds.","url":"https:\/\/eurradiolexp.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s41747-018-0064-3","name":"Emphysema quantification using chest CT: influence of radiation dose reduction and reconstruction technique","publisher":"European Radiology Experimental","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAVP8wUBc-nKimtpz22Rwt38Uenu0S1ClYw,NAME_SEARCH,A1_X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABNz3jcBQBxdTXZhFmtd3jDMeut-UOqeFpg,NAME_SEARCH,MwBS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGIqI0BVFVuSx2m-XSiC14peLevXYnPe7I,NAME_SEARCH,-7UY)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHuqpMBt2HUp6tgjYNpyu0lel3SdXTsD6o,NAME_SEARCH,sh6d)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAG2NkIBRcWfi2D5xQThG4ECsC9hZmDrrT8,NAME_SEARCH,re3n)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB1jatkBAs4xch4hmz9T09VPgXEluWXOuzA,NAME_SEARCH,5did)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":6,"year":2019},"description":"BACKGROUND:\nMetal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty (MoM THA) is associated with the formation of pseudotumours.

Patients presenting at the department of radiation oncology with symptomatic bone metastases in the appendicular skeleton, as well as in the sacrum and sternum were eligible for inclusion. All participants underwent EBRT, followed by MR-HIFU within 4 days. Safety and feasibility were assessed, and pain scores were monitored for 4 weeks after completing the combined treatment.\n\nResults: \nSix patients were enrolled. Median age was 67 years, median lesion diameter was 56,5 mm. In all patients it was logistically possible to plan and perform the MR-HIFU treatment within 4 days after EBRT.

In this systematic review, an overview is provided of reproductive outcomes after these two relatively new ablation techniques.\n\nMethod: \nA systematic literature search was performed to identify studies reporting reproductive outcomes after HIFU treatment of fibroids. Only peer reviewed, full papers were included. Outcomes included pregnancy-, live-birth- miscarriage and caesarian section rate, time to conceive, reported complications, and possible prognostic factors.\n\nResults: \nIn total 21 studies were included. Fourteen studies reported 124 pregnancies after MR-HIFU. Two placenta previas and no uterus ruptures were reported. Pregnancy rates were only retrospectively collected and ranged between 7% and 36%. Miscarriage rate in the oldest and largest prospective registry was 39%. After USgHIFU 366 pregnancies were reported with one fetal intrauterine death, six placenta previas and no uterus ruptures. The only prospective study reported a pregnancy rate of 47% and a miscarriage rate of 11%. Possible prognostic factors like age were not available in most studies.\n\nConclusions: \nBased on the heterogeneous data currently available, reproductive outcomes after HIFU appear non-inferior to outcomes after the current standard of care. However, a (randomized) controlled trial comparing reproductive outcomes after HIFU and standard care is necessary to provide sufficient evidence on the preferred fibroid treatment for women with a pregnancy wish.","url":"https:\/\/www.ejradiology.com\/article\/S0720-048X(21)00282-5\/fulltext","name":"Systematic review of reproductive outcomes after High Intensity Focused Ultrasound treatment of uterine fibroids","publisher":"Eur J Rad","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwIucQBzRSXCXI35e9_0DNYof0-eCkPnGA,NAME_SEARCH,8qEM)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABtLVV8BmoxMMurfUBxLAzvtt8StAZduB54,NAME_SEARCH,eEgg)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXZG2kBT78OdcmLcJCxRs6kwzW9AZTvwA8,NAME_SEARCH,h_qq)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADzPycB8Ko0iJmknvrGvk2yoz2wPFMA2rk,NAME_SEARCH,P_3D)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACwy11EBUxjWMeJPOAM0Y0af1d5LhooOZy8,NAME_SEARCH,l64U)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJwXhUBRIQZebv0njtYmKvidRRSTSHmkYQ,NAME_SEARCH,4woG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYVbTYBVhC23kA1ZV5AIdDTklPmZsZobms,NAME_SEARCH,Zvf6)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":14,"year":2021},"description":"Background: \nBrain growth in moderate preterm (MP; gestational age (GA) 32+0\u201333+6 weeks) and late preterm infants (LP; GA 34+0\u201336+6 weeks) may be impaired, even in the absence of brain injury.\nAims: \nThe aims of this study were to assess brain measurements of MP and LP infants, and to compare these with full-term infants (GA > 37 weeks) using linear cranial ultrasound (cUS) at term equivalent age (TEA).\nStudy design: \ncUS data from two prospective cohorts were combined.

Although fracture characteristics have been described, the relationship with clinical outcome is lacking. The purpose of this study was to get insight into the type of treatment and subsequent clinical outcome after all types of FFP.\n\nMethods: \nA cross-sectional cohort study was performed including all elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with a CT-diagnosed FFP, between 2007-2019 in two level 1 trauma centers. Data regarding treatment, mortality and clinical outcome was gathered from the electronic patient files. Patients were asked to complete patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) regarding physical functioning (SMFA) and quality of life (EQ-5D). Additionally, a standardized multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was constructed.\n\nResults: \nA total of 187 patients were diagnosed with an FFP of whom 117 patients were available for follow-up analysis and 58 patients responded. FFP type I was most common (60%), followed by type II (27%), type III (8%) and type IV (5%). Almost all injuries were treated non-operatively (98%). Mobility at six weeks ranged from 50% (type III) to 80% type II). Mortality at 1 year was respectively 16% (type I and II), 47% (type III) and 13% (type IV). Physical functioning (SMFA function index) ranged from 62 (type III and IV) to 69 (type II) and was significantly decreased (P=<0.001) compared to the age-matched general population. Quality of life was also significantly decreased, ranging from 0.26 (type III) to 0.69 (type IV).\n\nConclusions: \nFFP type I and II are most common. Treatment is mainly non-operative, resulting in good mobility after six weeks, especially for patients with FFP type I and II. Mortality rates at one year were substantial in all patients. Physical functioning and quality of life was about 20-30% decreased compared to the general population.","url":"https:\/\/www.injuryjournal.com\/article\/S0020-1383(21)00837-8\/fulltext","name":"What is the long-term clinical outcome after fragility fractures of the pelvis? - A CT-based cross-sectional study","publisher":"Injury","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASXomwBNfrI84Kj_phoYQX9OeUPvBz1zhA,NAME_SEARCH,r-Yh)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAeXbzYBJy-9mCF5pb7bZG1hQjPTyZjPThs,NAME_SEARCH,WLD7)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA0-ZGMBsnKUpy05FVnh4ClxsVYpV4XI_HU,NAME_SEARCH,GTO7)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA1idNcB7-tHC_gpN8KM7pWMMtxvssxXF98,NAME_SEARCH,lvrP)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":24,"year":2021},"description":"Objective: \nTo quantify metal artifact reduction using 130 keV virtual monochromatic imaging (VMI) with and without orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR) in total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: \nConventional polychromatic images and 130 keV VMI of a phantom with pellets representing bone with unilateral or bilateral prostheses were reconstructed with and without O-MAR on a dual-layer CT.

Five women (16.7%) experienced temporary tachycardia, one women in combination with headache, within 30\u00a0min after carbetocin administration.\nConclusion: Administration of the long-acting uterus stimulant carbetocin improved the MR-HIFU treatment intra-subject sonication efficiency in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S235204772200020X","name":"Increased MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) sonication efficiency of uterine fibroids after carbetocin administration","publisher":"Eur J Radiology Open","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABwIucQBzRSXCXI35e9_0DNYof0-eCkPnGA,NAME_SEARCH,8qEM)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABtLVV8BmoxMMurfUBxLAzvtt8StAZduB54,NAME_SEARCH,eEgg)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGL6OQBlo8nnVewV9bwar220FZAdAV_tOw,NAME_SEARCH,MmN-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAYVbTYBVhC23kA1ZV5AIdDTklPmZsZobms,NAME_SEARCH,Zvf6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEcwpABNZ9ylfFq3dqQ0VtjCpqa7qyRWgo,NAME_SEARCH,AI0z)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXZG2kBT78OdcmLcJCxRs6kwzW9AZTvwA8,NAME_SEARCH,h_qq)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAE53QAB3O4inJKpk7Pax_IjDPawZ2mW4To,NAME_SEARCH,W7BH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABZw6ygBMKUOY3zkkPKStN3JY_UwhqudUBA,NAME_SEARCH,GYXC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABNz3jcBQBxdTXZhFmtd3jDMeut-UOqeFpg,NAME_SEARCH,MwBS)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":8,"year":2022},"description":"Preterm birth remains an important cause of abnormal neurodevelopment.

The MRI exam included a T1-weighted multiple gradient echo sequence for sCT reconstruction. For qualitative image assessment, four structures at two vertebral levels were evaluated on sCT and compared with CT by three assessors using a four-point scale (range 1\u20134). The noninferiority margin was set at 0.5 point on this scale. Additionally, acceptable image quality was defined as a score of 3\u20134 in \u2265 80% of the scans.

The objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning\u2013based method for translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression.\n\nMethods\nThe algorithm was retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June 2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans.\n\nResults\nDice coefficient of NPVs was 71% (\u00b1 22%).

In potentially contaminated hernia, recurrences rise to 40%. Recently, the biosynthetic Phasix mesh has been developed that is resorbed in 12-18 months. Resorbable meshes might be a solution for incisional hernia repair to decrease short- and long-term (mesh) complications. However, long-term outcomes after resorption are scarce.\n\nMethods: Patients with VHWG grade 3 incisional midline hernia, who participated in the Phasix trial (Clinilcaltrials.gov: NCT02720042) were included by means of physical examination and computed tomography (CT). Primary outcome was hernia recurrence; secondary outcomes comprised of long-term mesh complications, reoperations, and abdominal wall pain [visual analogue score (VAS): 0-10].\n\nResults: In total, 61\/84 (72.6%) patients were seen. Median follow-up time was 60.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 55-64] months. CT scan was made in 39 patients (68.4%). A recurrence rate of 15.9% (95% confidence interval: 6.9-24.8) was calculated after 5 years. Four new recurrences (6.6%) were found between 2 and 5 years. Two were asymptomatic.

Although some patients with MoP THAs experienced pseudotumors, the risk of a pseudotumor was much greater in MoM hips, and serum ion levels were higher in patients who received an MoM THA.

Prophylactic mesh placement has shown promising results, but long-term outcomes are needed. The present study aimed to assess the long-term incisional hernia rates of the previously conducted PRIMA trial with radiological follow-up.\n\nMethods: In the PRIMA trial, patients with increased risk of incisional hernia formation (AAA or BMI \u226527 kg\/m2) were randomised in a 1:2:2 ratio to primary suture, onlay mesh or sublay mesh closure in three different countries in eleven institutions. Incisional hernia during follow-up was diagnosed by any of: CT, ultrasound and physical examination, or during surgery. Assessors and patients were blinded until 2-year follow-up.

More information on reliability and validity of pSWE systems is needed. Therefore, we performed a phantom study to evaluate the validity and reliability of pSWE with ultrasound systems.\n\nMethods: \nValidity and reliability of pSWE measurements from three ultrasound systems were evaluated. Measurements were performed on an elasticity phantom with reference elasticities of 7 \u00b1 1 (low) (median \u00b1 interquartile range (IQR)), 14 \u00b1 2 (medium) and 26 \u00b1 3 (high) kPa. Measurements were repeated in tenfold for each reference at 2, 3 and 4 cm depth. Results were considered valid when median elasticity \u00b1 IQR was between the uncertainty limits (IQR) for each reference elasticity value and reliable when IQR\/median < 0.30.\n\nResults: \npSWE with the systems provided valid results for all reference elasticities and focal depths, except for overestimation of high reference elasticity at 2 and 4 cm depth for one system (41.5 \u00b1 4.3 and 39.0 \u00b1 1.2 kPa, respectively). Measurements were reliable with a maximum IQR\/median of 0.13, well below the guideline of IQR\/median < 0.30.\n\nDiscussion: \nThe results support the use of pSWE as an alternative to invasive or non-image guided noninvasive techniques for liver fibrotic staging.\n\nConclusions: \npSWE with ultrasound systems from different vendors is valid and reliable and can therefore be implemented to optimize clinical workflow by performing imaging and elastography simultaneously.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40477-023-00854-9","name":"Image-guided point-shear-wave elastography: a valid and reliable technique for liver fibrotic staging","publisher":"J Ultrasound","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACDXsTIB2uRehknCKWU6vQzqbgSJzg5_eCQ,NAME_SEARCH,GsgJ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA6Ugx4BK8gG1EM2L5gCUE2TSZq0fbb-GnM,NAME_SEARCH,rod-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAH2ZC0B2yq0lysCVkxiugvIHonJelgyKSU,NAME_SEARCH,EJ5w)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXCdFwBEe5bm2QY_2-UP2kNH8Dyy6yEOGI,NAME_SEARCH,grPu)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACT8VP0BEvrsY2NS8BMKv3RnKofgeqL8y6Y,NAME_SEARCH,dxsO)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXZG2kBT78OdcmLcJCxRs6kwzW9AZTvwA8,NAME_SEARCH,h_qq)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAdg7BoB8tjdWbWdSf9_FP0pMabjw-n3V8c,NAME_SEARCH,MISQ)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":13,"year":2024},"description":"Purpose\n\nTo evaluate the diagnostic performance and generalizability of the winning DL algorithm of the RSNA 2020 PE detection challenge to a local population using CTPA data from two hospitals.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nConsecutive CTPA images from patients referred for suspected PE were retrospectively analysed. The winning RSNA 2020 DL algorithm was retrained on the RSNA-STR Pulmonary Embolism CT (RSPECT) dataset. The algorithm was tested in hospital A on multidetector CT (MDCT) images of 238 patients and in hospital B on spectral detector CT (SDCT) and virtual monochromatic images (VMI) of 114 patients. The output of the DL algorithm was compared with a reference standard, which included a consensus reading by at least two experienced cardiothoracic radiologists for both hospitals. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using the maximum Youden index.\n\nResults\n\nAccording to the reference standard, PE was present in 73 patients (30.7%) in hospital A and 33 patients (29.0%) in hospital B. For the DL algorithm the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.92\u20130.98) in hospital A, 0.89 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.94) for conventional reconstruction in hospital B and 0.87 (95% CI 0.80\u20130.93) for VMI.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe RSNA 2020 pulmonary embolism detection on CTPA challenge winning DL algorithm, retrained on the RSPECT dataset, showed high diagnostic accuracy on MDCT images.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess bone microarchitecture and strength in a large cohort of adults with OI using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) and to evaluate challenges of using HR-pQCT in this cohort. Second-generation HR-pQCT scans were obtained at the distal radius and tibia in 118 men and women with Sillence OI type I, III, or IV using an extremity-length dependent scan protocol. In total, 102 radius and 105 tibia scans of sufficient quality could be obtained, of which 11 radius scans (11%) and 14 tibia scans (13%) had a deviated axial scan angle as compared to axial angle data of 13 young women. In the scans without a deviated axial angle and compared to normative HR-pQCT data, Z-scores at the radius for trabecular BMD, number, and separation were -1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, -2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4, and -2.7 (IQR: 2.7), respectively. They were -1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 and -1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 for stiffness and failure load and between \u00b11 for trabecular thickness and cortical bone parameters. Z-scores were significantly lower for total and trabecular BMD, stiffness, failure load, and cortical area and thickness at the tibia. Additionally, local microarchitectural inhomogeneities were observed; most pronounced being trabecular void volumes. In the scans with a deviated axial angle, the proportion of Z-scores <-4 or\u2009>\u20094 was significantly higher for trabecular BMD and separation (radius) or most total and trabecular bone parameters (tibia). To conclude, especially trabecular bone microarchitecture and bone strength were impaired in adults with OI. HR-pQCT may be used without challenges in most adults with OI, but approximately 12% of the scans may have a deviated axial angle in OI due to bone deformities or scan positioning limitations. Furthermore, standard HR-pQCT parameters may not always be reliable due to microarchitectural inhomogeneities nor fully reflect all inhomogeneities.","url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jbmr\/advance-article\/doi\/10.1093\/jbmr\/zjae013\/7589768?login=false","name":"Bone microarchitecture and strength assessment in adults with osteogenesis imperfecta using HR-pQCT: normative comparison and challenges","publisher":"J Bone Miner Res","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA3V2fEBQj2Sn0mSc54d21iODDUgBIJ6Xng,NAME_SEARCH,8jeF)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":14,"year":2024},"description":"Background: \nTo compare image quality, metal artifacts, and diagnostic confidence of conventional computed tomography (CT) images of unilateral total hip arthroplasty patients (THA) with deep learning-based metal artifact reduction (DL-MAR) to conventional CT and 130-keV monoenergetic images with and without orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR).\n\nMethods: \nConventional CT and 130-keV monoenergetic images with and without O-MAR and DL-MAR images of 28 unilateral THA patients were reconstructed.

The moment the patient entered the day care-unit until she left, defined our boundaries of investigation.

Primary outcomes were non-perfused volume ratio (NPV%), lesion size, pain scores, side effects and complication rates according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines. Secondary outcomes were recurrence and re-intervention rates. Seven cohort studies (one of good methodological quality) (LoE 3) on USgHIFU were included (n = 212, AWE lesions = 240-245). Six months after USgHIFU treatment, pain scores were reduced with 3.3-5.2 points (baseline: 5.1-6.8, n = 135). Self-limiting side effects were pain (85.7 % (114\/133)) and swelling (34.6 % (46\/133)) in the treatment area. Complications occurred in 17.7 % (32\/181), all of which were minor. Recurrence occurred in 12.8 % (11\/86). Three of these seven cohort studies compared USgHIFU (n = 61) with surgical excision (n = 74). Pooled results showed no significant differences in pain scores, complications (resp. 26.3 % (10\/38) vs. 32.6 % (15\/46) (p = 0.53)) and recurrences (resp. 4.9 % (3\/61) vs. 5.4 % (4\/74) (p = 0.90)). This systematic review suggests that HIFU is an effective and safe treatment option for AWE. USgHIFU treatment led to reduced pain scores and lesion size, was free of major complications and had a pooled recurrence rate of 12.8 %. Compared to surgical excision pooled results showed no significant differences in pain scores, complications and recurrences after USgHIFU. However, many of the included studies had limitations in their methodological quality and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.

De hype is voorbij, maar het materiaal is nog steeds \u201ebijzonder en verrassend\u201d.","fullText":"Vijftien jaar geleden was het ultradunne materiaal grafeen een hype. Er werden miljoenen in ge\u00efnvesteerd en er verschenen jaarlijks duizenden wetenschappelijke publicaties. Hoe staat het grafeenonderzoek er nu voor? Waar blijven de veelbelovende toepassingen, zoals oprolbare schermen en effici\u00ebntere computerchips? \u201eGrafeen was geen lege hype\u201d, zegt de Leidse natuurkundige Sense Jan van der Molen. \u201eMaar er is meer beloofd dan kan worden waargemaakt, zoals bij elke hype.\u201d Precies twintig jaar geleden pulkten natuurkundigen Andre Geim en Konstantin Novoselov met plakband flinterdunne koolstofschilfertjes van een blok grafiet. Dit experiment was onderdeel van de speelse vrijdagavondproeven van Geim. Die schilfertjes bleken grafeen: ultradunne velletjes koolstof van slechts \u00e9\u00e9n atoomlaag dik met de zeshoekige structuur van kippengaas. Het bestaan van grafeen was bekend. Natuurkundigen wisten ook dat grafiet \u2013 het materiaal van potloodpunten \u2013 is opgebouwd uit op elkaar gestapelde laagjes grafeen, als de kaarten van een kaartspel. Maar Geim en Novoselov waren in 2004 de eersten die de koolstofvelletjes op zo\u2019n manier wisten los te peuteren dat ze het materiaal konden onderzoeken. Dat leverde ze in 2010 de Nobelprijs voor Natuurkunde op . Toen het mogelijk bleek om een enkele laag grafeen te isoleren, zagen onderzoekers al snel de voorspelde bijzondere eigenschappen. Het is het dunste materiaal dat je kunt maken \u2013 dunner dan een enkele laag atomen kan niet. Daardoor is het transparant en licht, een vel grafeen ter grootte van een voelbalveld weegt minder dan een gram. Toch is het flexibel, sterker dan staal en is het zo dicht dat zelfs heliumgas er niet doorheen komt. Elektriciteit stroomt er net zo goed doorheen als door koper en het geleidt warmte beter dan enig ander materiaal. De publicatie waarin Geim en Novoselov in 2004 hun vrijdagavondbevindingen presenteerden trok wereldwijd de aandacht. \u201eDe uitzonderlijke eigenschappen openden de deur naar zo veel nieuwe mogelijkheden dat een hele onderzoeksgemeenschap op grafeen dook\u201d, zegt Sten Vollebregt, universitair hoofddocent aan de TU Delft. \u201eDaarbij hielp het dat iedereen met een rol plakband en een stuk grafiet het zelf kon maken en onderzoeken in het lab.\u201d In eerste instantie was er vooral enthousiasme onder fundamentele wetenschappers omdat de bijzondere elektrische en magnetische eigenschappen nieuw natuurkundig onderzoek mogelijk maken, vertelt Sense Jan van der Molen, hoogleraar natuurkunde aan de Universiteit Leiden. \u201eElektronen gedragen zich in grafeen bijvoorbeeld alsof ze geen massa hebben en bewegen razendsnel door het materiaal. Daardoor kun je bepaalde quantumeffecten en zelfs de relativistische fysica van Einstein bestuderen.\u201d De uitzonderlijke eigenschappen van het wondermateriaal zorgden voor een snel groeiende lijst van mogelijke toepassingen en patenten: oprolbare schermen, betere computerchips, batterijen, zonnepanelen, lichtere vliegtuigen, filters voor waterontzilting, sensoren en sterke en warmtegeleidende composietmaterialen. Het grafeenonderzoek is inmiddels twintig jaar oud, maar er liggen nog nauwelijks grafeenproducten in de winkel. Er zijn slechts een paar kleinschalige \u2013 niet zo hightech \u2013 toepassingen van het wondermateriaal, zoals een motorhelm met een stevige, warmte afvoerende grafeencoating, een koptelefoon die een betere geluidskwaliteit belooft dankzij grafeen en een extra licht en sterk padelracket. Ook is er grafeenverf, -inkt en -rubber met warmtegeleidende of elektrische eigenschappen. Deze toepassingen zijn duur en hebben zich nog niet bewezen. Is de hype uitgedoofd? Het onderzoek naar grafeen is zeker niet stilgevallen, maar de piek van ruim tien jaar geleden lijkt voorbij, zegt Peter Steeneken, hoogleraar toegepaste nanofysica aan de TU Delft. \u201eEen deel van de industrie die erop sprong, heeft zich inmiddels weer teruggetrokken\u201d, vertelt hij. \u201eMen was destijds erg optimistisch over hoe snel grafeen naar de markt gebracht zou kunnen worden. Dit optimisme is een gebruikelijk fenomeen bij nieuwe technologische doorbraken \u2013 het wordt ook wel de peak of inflated expectations genoemd\u201d, de piek van opgeblazen verwachtingen. De lange ontwikkeltijd heeft vooral te maken met een praktisch probleem: hoe maak je meer dan een paar schilfertjes hoogwaardig grafeen? Als je het wilt gebruiken voor zonnepanelen of oprolbare computerschermen, dan heb je vellen grafeen nodig van meerdere vierkante decimeters of vierkante meters. En voor toepassingen in de elektronica moet je op een betrouwbare en snelle manier grafeen kunnen maken, waarbij de koolstofatomen over het hele oppervlak keurig in het gelid staan, vertelt Richard van Rijn, oprichter en technisch directeur van het Nederlandse grafeenbedrijf Applied Nanolayers. \u201eDat lukt niet met een rol plakband en een blok grafiet.\u201d De afgelopen jaren zijn er andere productiemethoden ontwikkeld. Applied Nanolayers maakt grafeen door een koolstofhoudend gas te verhitten boven een oppervlak. De koolstofatomen komen dan vrij uit het gas en vormen \u2013 bij de juiste temperatuur en het juiste oppervlaktemateriaal \u2013 een grafeenlaag op die ondergrond. Van Rijn: \u201eOp die manier laten we een laag grafeen groeien op een wafer \u2013 een ronde plaat \u2013 van 20 centimeter.\u201d Het is daarbij de kunst om ervoor te zorgen dat alle stukjes grafeen netjes naast elkaar liggen, zodat het resultaat er niet uitziet als een rommelige lappendeken, zegt Van Rijn. Als dat gelukt is, dan kan het bedrijf die laag sinds kort van de wafer afpellen en verplaatsen, zonder dat het materiaal daarbij verfrommelt of kapot gaat. We zijn het plakbandstadium voorbij Peter Steeneken TU Delft Hoewel het trager ging dan verwacht, zijn er sinds 2004 wel \u201egigantische stappen\u201d gezet in het grafeenonderzoek, zegt Steeneken. \u201eWe begrijpen de eigenschappen en mogelijkheden van grafeen beter en we zijn het plakbandstadium voorbij.\u201d Bedrijven zoals Applied Nanolayers leveren nu materialen aan universiteiten, onderzoeksinstituten en onderzoeksafdelingen van bedrijven. De productiemethoden moeten volgens Steeneken nog wel volwassener worden voordat grafeen gebruikt kan worden in commerci\u00eble hightechtoepassingen. \u201eEr zijn grote vorderingen gemaakt, maar er moeten nog meer grote stappen gezet worden voordat het materiaal in je smartphone zit. Die ontwikkelingen zullen nog zeker tien tot twintig jaar duren.\u201d Volgens de Delftse onderzoekers zorgt de gestage vooruitgang ervoor dat de interesse bij de industrie ook langzaam terugkomt. Daarbij wordt minder hoog van de toren geblazen dan tijdens de eerste hype. De beloftes over droomtoepassingen zijn teruggeschroefd en er wordt meer gekeken naar kleinschaliger, realistische nichetoepassingen. \u201eNu het vakgebied wat volwassener is geworden weten we beter wat er wel en niet kan met grafeen\u201d, zegt Vollebregt. \u201eEn alleen de onderzoeksgroepen en bedrijven die er serieus aan werken, zijn overgebleven.\u201d Wat betekent dit voor de lijst met veelbelovende hightechtoepassingen? De meeste voorstellen zijn geen sciencefiction, al duurt het langer dan gehoopt voordat ze op de markt zijn. En voor een paar toepassingen bleek grafeen toch niet het ideale materiaal. Een voorbeeld zijn de zonnepanelen, touchscreens en oprolbare schermen. Het ultradunne, transparante en elektriciteit geleidende grafeen leek daar perfect voor. Maar het blijkt niet (of nog niet) te kunnen concurreren met het materiaal dat hier nu voor gebruikt wordt: indiumtinoxide. \u201eGrafeen is op zijn best even goed als indiumtinoxide en nog wel veel duurder\u201d, zegt Vollebregt. \u201eMisschien dat het in de toekomst goedkoper wordt of toch geschikter blijkt voor bepaalde toepassingen, zoals vouwbare elektronica, omdat grafeen flexibeler is.\u201d Een andere veelgenoemde toepassing waar nu minder aandacht voor is dan tien jaar geleden, is grafeen als transistor. Transistoren zijn minuscule elektronische schakelaartjes die de basis vormen van computerchips. Ze zijn nu gemaakt van het halfgeleidermateriaal silicium. Grafeen leek de ideale opvolger. Elektronen bewegen razendsnel door het wondermateriaal, warmte wordt gemakkelijk afgevoerd en omdat het flinterdun is, zou je kleinere transistoren kunnen maken waardoor er meer op een chip passen. \u201eDaardoor zou je goedkopere en snellere chips krijgen die ook nog minder energie gebruiken\u201d, zegt Steeneken. Maar grafeen heeft een groot nadeel: het kan niet uit en zou dus een schakelaartje opleveren dat altijd aan staat. Dat is vrijwel nutteloos. Steeneken: \u201e Er zijn trucs waarmee je grafeen wel kunt uitzetten, maar in de meeste gevallen verlies je dan een aantal van de mooie eigenschappen.\u201d Welke toepassingen van grafeen kunnen we wel binnenkort op de markt verwachten? Volgens Van Rijn zijn dat waarschijnlijk meer nichetoepassingen, zoals sensoren en fotonica, waarbij chips werken met licht in plaats van elektronen. \u201eJe kunt met grafeen licht razendsnel sturen en detecteren\u201d, vertelt hij. \u201eGrafeen kan ook een goede gas-, bio- of druksensor zijn.\u201d Omdat het zo dun is, is het namelijk heel gevoelig voor kleine krachten die erop werken en je kunt het materiaal eenvoudig aanpassen zodat het op verschillende stoffen of krachten reageert. \u201eDe sensorontwikkelingen gaan nu snel\u201d, zegt Van Rijn. \u201eIk denk dat er over twee tot drie jaar grafeensensoren op de markt zijn.\u201d Er is een sector waar grafeen al bijna twintig jaar een bloeiend vakgebied is: de fundamentele wetenschap. \u201eWetenschappelijk gezien vind ik de hype terecht\u201d, zegt Sense Jan van der Molen. \u201eIk vind het nog steeds een bijzonder en verrassend materiaal. Als ik er college over geef, merk ik aan de studenten dat ze dat ook vinden. Binnen de wetenschap en toepassingen binnen de wetenschap vindt grafeen zijn weg.\u201d Onderzoekers gebruiken grafeen bijvoorbeeld om het quantumgedrag van elektronen in het materiaal te onderzoeken. Dat leverde interessante natuurkundige ontdekkingen op. Zo lukte het fysici onlangs voor het eerst om met twee grafeenlaagjes een zogenoemd Wigner-kristal te maken, waarvan het bestaan in 1934 voorspeld werd. Dat is een kristalstructuur die niet uit atomen, maar volledig uit elektronen bestaat. En een paar jaar geleden bleek dat als je twee grafeenvelletjes op de juiste manier op elkaar legt, dat het geheel dan supergeleidend wordt . De elektrische weerstand in het materiaal verdwijnt dan volledig en elektriciteit stroomt er ongehinderd doorheen. Bovendien heeft grafeen als ultradun en geleidend materiaal een aantal nuttige toepassingen in de wetenschap, zoals in de microscopie. \u201eJe kunt grafeen bijvoorbeeld gebruiken om piepkleine vloeistofcelletjes af te sluiten\u201d, vertelt Van der Molen. \u201eOmdat grafeen zo dun is, zal dit de microscoopwaarnemingen niet verstoren. Dat is geen toepassing die miljarden oplevert, zoals oprolbare schermen, maar het maakt wel nieuw onderzoek mogelijk.\u201d Het vakgebied dat begon met grafeen is inmiddels breder. Er blijken namelijk meer ultradunne materialen te bestaan. \u201eEr zijn honderden tweedimensionale materialen ontdekt van \u00e9\u00e9n of hooguit een paar atoomlagen dik\u201d, vertelt Vollebregt. \u201eElk hebben ze bijzondere eigenschappen, wat de deur opent naar allerlei nieuwe mogelijkheden.\u201d Er zitten bijvoorbeeld materialen bij die \u2013 in tegenstelling tot grafeen \u2013 wel geschikt zijn als transistor voor computerchips. \u201eDie materialen staan op de agenda bij grote chipbedrijven zoals Intel, Samsung en TSMC\u201d, vertelt Steeneken. Wat deze nieuwe hype verder aanwakkert, is de mogelijkheid om verschillende tweedimensionale materialen op elkaar te stapelen \u2013 als legoblokje \u2013 om de bijzondere eigenschappen te combineren. Je kunt dan bijvoorbeeld een halfgeleiderlaagje gebruiken dat werkt als transistor en die combineren met een grafeenlaagje dat de warmte afvoert, zodat je computer niet te heet wordt. \u201eUiteindelijk zouden we tweedimensionale materialen zo kunnen gaan stapelen dat we een soort superdun sandwichmateriaal hebben dat geoptimaliseerd is voor een specifieke toepassing, zoals snelle en energiezuinige computerchips\u201d, zegt Vollebregt. Dat soort designermaterialen zijn nu nog toekomstmuziek. De tweedimensionale materialen en de stapeltechniek moeten eerst verder ontwikkeld worden. Dit wekt de indruk dat de grafeenhype langzaam wordt overgenomen door de hype van de tweedimensionale materialen. Die hype wakkerde Nobelprijswinnaar Andre Geim vorig jaar aan in een interview met het BBC Radio 4 programma The Life Scientific : \u201eDe mensheid heeft in diens vooruitgang telkens gebruikgemaakt van verschillende materialen \u2013 denk maar aan de steentijd, bronstijd, ijzertijd en nu leven we in het tijdperk van silicium en plastic. Ik denk dat er aanwijzingen zijn dat we aan de vooravond staan van het tijdperk van tweedimensionale materialen.\u201d Hij voegde eraan toe dat hij misschien overdreef, maar dat zou de komende dertig tot vijftig jaar dan wel duidelijk worden.

Haug , M.D., PhD.2 Received: February 7, 2024; Accepted: February 7, 2024; Published: March 15, 2024 Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) must meet the same bar for clinical evidence as other clinical interventions. Trials that start enrolling patients after January 1, 2025 and that use an AI intervention as part of an approach to answering a clinical question will need to be regis- tered in a trial database that meets the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform specification or contributes data to this WHO platform if the final work is to be considered for publication in NEJM AI. T he primary goal of NEJM AI is to provide information that improves the ability of clinicians and health care systems to deliver safe and effective health care using artificial intelligence (AI). This means that in addition to needed technical advances, AI must meet the same bar for clinical evidence as other clinical interventions, preferably using randomized, controlled trials designed to test the tool against an estab- lished standard.1 For example, consider testing whether an AI tool embedded in an elec- tronic health record will improve patient outcomes compared with the same task done without AI; it is self-evident that such a test is different from testing the effectiveness of a drug. Despite this enhanced complexity, AI has the potential to tackle the complex infor- mation management tasks involved in modern medicine and thereby, improve the health care delivered to patients. However, clinical research standards must be followed to trans- late this potential to proven clinical benefit. We already recommend that researchers who want to submit to NEJM AI follow agreed-upon standards, such as SPIRIT and CONSORT-AI.2,3 In the future, we will also require that all trials of AI inventions be prere- gistered, as detailed below. In September 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) changed the course of interventional medical research by establishing a requirement for registration of a clinical trial in a public database before the enrollment of the first patient.4 Such a registration was necessary for a research report to be considered for publication in an ICMJE member journal. The purpose was simple. People who are willing to put them- selves at risk for the advancement of medical knowledge are the most precious resource needed in the conduct of a clinical trial, and thus, those people deserve to have the research question for which their data are being used made public so that when the results The author affiliations are listed at the end of the article.

For registration, the ICMJE defined a clinical trial as \u201cany research project that prospectively assigns humans to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome.\u201d Now, nearly 20 years after the ICMJE stated its position, trial registration is standard practice among clinical trial- ists. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estab- lished the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which has codified the dataset needed to indicate that a given trial is fully registered (https:\/\/www.who.int\/ clinical-trials-registry-platform). It is important to remem- ber that for trials to be clinically directive, they must address a definable and vital medical issue. For research to achieve a priority high enough to merit publication in NEJM AI, the investigators must show that the AI interven- tion provides clinically informative or directive outcomes. As Isaac Kohane wrote earlier this year: \u201cRandomized con- trolled trials with LLMs will not be easy. The breadth of such models\u2019 capabilities and unknowns about what data they have already \u2018seen\u2019 make their evaluation of narrowly defined tasks somewhat artificial and not entirely reflective of their usage by clinicians or patients. Ensuring that pluripo- tent AI programs are \u2018clinical grade\u2019 and safe will require a multifaceted, collaborative approach among clinicians, patient advocacy groups, and many stakeholders.\u201d1 Transpar- ency will be the principal tool needed to win the trust of our readers, regardless of the form this evaluation takes. Proper prior registration of these trials will add to this transparency. There has been uncertainty in the medical AI community about what constitutes a clinical trial that requires regis- tration. For example, different approaches to an AI-driven clinical decision support module in an electronic health record may be trialed to see which is most effective in providing the clinician with a clinically actionable plan. Is such an exercise a quality improvement endeavor or a clinical trial? This is an important distinction because the former may not be viewed as requiring trial registration, whereas the latter would require registration. We realize that drawing a bright line between these two approaches is impossible. Still, to avoid ambiguity, NEJM AI has made the editorial decision that any trial in which human data are gathered prospectively to determine the utility of an intervention requires trial registration even if the local institutional review board or ethics committee determines that the exercise is for quality improvement and that indi- vidual patient consent is not needed. Therefore, any trial that starts enrolling patients after Jan- uary 1, 2025 and that uses an AI intervention as part of its approach to answer a clinical question will need to be registered in a trial database that meets the WHO ICTRP specification or contributes data to this WHO platform if the final work is to be considered for publication in NEJM AI. This is the accepted standard among all current clini- cal trialists and journals that publish clinical research, and we hope it will be the future standard for the AI research community.
