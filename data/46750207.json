monoclonal antibodies have been developed successfully for the treatment of various diseases. Nevertheless, the development of biotherapeutic antibodies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming, and to facilitate this process, careful structural analysis beyond the antibody binding site is required to develop a more efficacious antibody. In this work, we focused on protein antigens, since they induce the largest antibody changes, and provide interesting cases to compare and contrast. The structures of 15 anti-protein antibodies were analysed to compare the antigen-bound\/unbound forms. Surprisingly, three different classes of binding-induced changes were identified. In class (B1), the antigen binding fragment distorted significantly, and we found changes in the loop region of the heavy chain\u2019s constant domain; this corresponds well with expected allosteric movements. In class (B2), we found changes in the same loop region without the overall distortion. In class (B3), these changes did not present, and only local changes at the complementarity determining regions were found. Consequently, structural analysis of antibodies is crucial for therapeutic development. Careful evaluation of allosteric movements must be undertaken to develop better effector responses, especially during the transformation of these antibodies from small fragments at the discovery stage to full antibodies at the subsequent development stages.","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-70680-0","name":"Antibody-protein binding and conformational changes: identifying allosteric signalling pathways to engineer a better effector response","publisher":"Scientific Reports","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAG0X68B7ynQTHaMQALSHkg1DH802WGdrjY,NAME_SEARCH,bdFc)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAZoZMMBbVTMNPS2TV623exaS0LOl3WFD0E,NAME_SEARCH,a2aT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHzD98BsF5dngTBpI6m2YRaVGyN1Y9fV7M,NAME_SEARCH,E3yg)"}]},{"name":"Photothermal Approach to Treat Head and Neck Cancer","publishedOn":{"month":9,"year":2019},"publisher":"Cancer Laryngectomee Trust","url":"http:\/\/www.cancerlt.org\/assets\/news\/newssep19.pdf","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":26,"year":2020},"description":"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a heterogeneous disease that includes a variety of tumors originating in the hypopharynx, oropharynx, lip, oral cavity, nasopharynx, or larynx. HNC is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and affects thousands of people in terms of incidence and mortality. Various factors can trigger the development of the disease such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and repetitive viral infections. HNC is currently treated by single or multimodality approaches, which are based on surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and biotherapeutic antibodies. The latter approach will be the focus of this article. There are currently three approved antibodies against HNCs (cetuximab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab), and 48 antibodies under development. The majority of these antibodies are of humanized (23 antibodies) or human (19 antibodies) origins, and subclass IgG1 represents a total of 32 antibodies. In addition, three antibody drug conjugates (ADCs: telisotuzumab-vedotin, indatuximab-ravtansine, and W0101) and two bispecific antibodies (GBR 1372 and ABL001) have been under development. Despite the remarkable success of antibodies in treating different tumors, success was limited in HNCs. This limitation is attributed to efficacy, resistance, and the appearance of various side effects. However, the efficacy of these antibodies could be enhanced through conjugation to gold nanoparticles (GNPs). These conjugates combine the high specificity of antibodies with unique spectral properties of GNPs to generate a treatment approach known as photothermal therapy. This approach can provide promising outcomes due to the ability of GNPs to convert light into heat, which can specifically destroy cancer cells and treat HNC in an effective manner.","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fonc.2020.559596\/full","name":"Biotherapeutic Antibodies for the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer: Current Approaches and Future Considerations of Photothermal Therapies","publisher":"Frontiers in Oncology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":17,"year":2021},"description":"Antibodies are well known for their high specificity that has enabled them to be of significant use in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Antibodies can recognize different antigens, including proteins, carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids, lipids, and small molecular weight haptens that are abundantly available as hormones, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Here we focus on a structural analysis of hapten-antibody couples and identify potential structural movements originating from the hapten binding by comparison with unbound antibody, utilizing 40 crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank. Our analysis reveals three binding surface trends; S1 where a pocket forms to accommodate the hapten, S2 where a pocket is removed when the hapten binds, and S3 where no pockets changes are found. S1 and S2 are expected for induced-fit binding, whereas S3 indicates that a pre-existing population of optimal binding antibody conformation exists. The structural analysis reveals four classifications of structural reorganization, some of which correlate to S2 but not to the other binding surface changes. These observations demonstrate the complexity of the antibody-antigen interaction, where structural changes can be restricted to the binding sites, or extend through the constant domains to propagate structural changes. This highlights the importance of structural analysis to ensure successful and compatible transformation of small antibody fragments at the early discovery stage into full antibodies during the subsequent development stages, where long-range structural changes are required for an Fc effector response.","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fmolb.2021.633526\/abstract","name":"Structural analysis of anti-hapten antibodies to identify long-range structural movements induced by hapten binding","publisher":"Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHzD98BsF5dngTBpI6m2YRaVGyN1Y9fV7M,NAME_SEARCH,E3yg)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAG0X68B7ynQTHaMQALSHkg1DH802WGdrjY,NAME_SEARCH,bdFc)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAZoZMMBbVTMNPS2TV623exaS0LOl3WFD0E,NAME_SEARCH,a2aT)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":23,"year":2021},"description":"Nanoparticles are small particles sized 1 to 100 nm, which have a large surface to volume ratio, allowing efficient adsorption of drugs, proteins and other chemical compounds.

Its ability to bind to the constant Fc regions of antibodies means it is useful for antibody extraction, and further integration with inorganic materials can lead to the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. We have investigated the adsorption of SpA on inorganic surface models such as experimentally relevant negatively charged silica, as well as positively charged and neutral surfaces, by use of fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We have found that SpA, which is itself negatively charged at pH7, is able to adsorb on all our surface models. However, adsorption on charged surfaces is more specific in terms of protein orientation compared to a neutral Au (111) surface, while the protein structure is generally well maintained in all cases. The results indicate that SpA adsorption is optimal on the siloxide-rich silica surface, which is negative at pH7 since this keeps the Fc binding regions free to interact with other species in solution. Due to the dominant role of electrostatics, the results are transferable to other inorganic materials and pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic designs where SpA might be used to conjugate antibodies to nanoparticles","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/23\/9\/4832","name":"Functionalisation of Inorganic Material Surfaces with Staphylococcus Protein A: A Molecular Dynamics Study","publisher":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB2U0egBZSB-D39u1B51XYJ063_RSD6NYCg,NAME_SEARCH,C6ky)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAG0X68B7ynQTHaMQALSHkg1DH802WGdrjY,NAME_SEARCH,bdFc)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAZoZMMBbVTMNPS2TV623exaS0LOl3WFD0E,NAME_SEARCH,a2aT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHzD98BsF5dngTBpI6m2YRaVGyN1Y9fV7M,NAME_SEARCH,E3yg)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":28,"year":2022},"description":"Antibodies play a crucial role in the immune response, in fighting off pathogens as well as helping create strong immunological memory.

The PTT approach primarily utilizes nanoparticles (NPs) made from metals, carbon, or semiconductors that can convert near-infrared laser irradiation, which penetrates tissues, into local heat that induces cancer cell death. An alternative approach is to utilize NPs (such as liposomes) to carry suitable dye molecules to the same end. Numerous studies concerning PTT have shown that local heat released in cancer cells may suppress the expression of membrane transporter proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), thus enhancing cytotoxicity and reverse multidrug resistance. In addition, because NPs may be loaded with different substances, researchers have designed multifunctional NPs for PTT by including several agents such as membrane transporter modulators, anticancer drugs, and photothermal agents. This review will focus on the recent advances in PTT utilizing various types of NPs, and their components and characteristics. In addition, the role of membrane transporters in PTT will be highlighted and different methods of transporter modulation will be summarized from several PTT studies in which multifunctional NPs were used to treat cancers in vitro and in vivo.","url":"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/15330338231168016","name":"Recent Advances in Photothermal Therapies Against Cancer and the Role of Membrane Transporter Modulators on the Efficacy of This Approach","publisher":"Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALJWf8BeXaMxDFOoUD0ZvVzN4mbwcaj-1w,NAME_SEARCH,_gdW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAjLCKwB8eoWWLOGucbeERacsxPvJW7vJZc,NAME_SEARCH,EzDk)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABI4_LEBYPa-N4eWgYVa7QS8h2BpUuVmqlo,NAME_SEARCH,-sRW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADoz2QBJltK23z7LOJYoctUkaqJJ6EaI2Q,NAME_SEARCH,rrwt)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAo4B5EBkRtjCeNiHxko32p6yU7bzUOzIT8,NAME_SEARCH,PkBB)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHzD98BsF5dngTBpI6m2YRaVGyN1Y9fV7M,NAME_SEARCH,E3yg)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714943040000,"insightId":"7698cf73-9fa8-4646-9771-1ec2cfe73f6d","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7192992551455313920","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192992551455313920","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7192992550964580355","message":{"attributes":[],"text":""},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E10AQEGQKSya8cgZA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1713792606089?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=ZoAFlmq4AJay1e0SeQqyJBgcFLmrSXu1z1kXk-IhGo8"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7188167205958602754","message":{"attributes":[{"start":227,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:acesmatter"}}},{"start":239,"length":28,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:adversechildhoodexperiences"}}},{"start":268,"length":5,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:aces"}}}],"text":"Noticing how we feel and how we behave when our nervous system is dysregulated can help shine a light on what needs to be addressed with curiosity and compassion.
