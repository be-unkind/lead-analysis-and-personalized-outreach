Regulatory scientists know the regulations, know how to read and interpret guidance documents, and to read FDA's Summary Basis of Approval documents. Often, though, this can falsely lead a regulatory person to take a position of \"No. FDA will say No. FDA won't allow it.\"\n\nRather, I use a different approach in developing a regulatory strategy, a 3-tiered approach. \n\nThinking of a triangle, the 1st tier, understanding the science, forms the base.\u00a0This ties the regulatory strategy to the basic science (e.g., mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics) and grounds the regulatory strategy to the underlying clinical need(s) of the patients we serve.\u00a0Understanding the science enables the Regulatory scientist to understand his\/her functional colleagues and provide more relevant and appropriate regulatory guidance to the program team and to the organization.\n\nThe 2nd tier is understanding the clinical\/business needs. \u00a0I typically start my consideration and evaluation of regulatory strategy from the perspective of the scientific\/business need(s) simultaneously derived with the clinical strategy.\u00a0The regulatory strategy has to be developed simultaneously with the technical strategy.\u00a0In doing so, then, the 2 are always in sync and support eachother.\n\nThe 3rd, and top, tier is to define what is possible within the confines of regulations, guidances, precedence, etc.\u00a0I have been surprised many times by what regulators are open to considering to potentially benefit patients, so I don\u2019t restrict my regulatory strategy to only what I believe may agreeable to regulators.\u00a0In preparing for meetings with regulators, I challenge my organization to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s possible.\"\u00a0I approach interactions with regulatory authorities with that same question to find out \u201cwhat\u2019s possible\u201d from a regulator perspective.\u00a0My principal tactic in working with regulatory agencies is to map out the space within which my organization can operate, to find the boundaries of what\u2019s possible based on direct feedback from regulators.\u00a0I make a proposal to the regulators a \"plan\" that attempts to address the regulator\u2019s needs while overlapping with the corporate strategy giving a win to both parties.\u00a0In doing so, then, the regulators can do their job of (typically) narrowing the boundaries of what we have proposed.\u00a0Once the \u201cregulatory\u201d boundaries are defined, then my organization goes off to solidify the final plan. \n\nUsing this 3-tiered approach avoids the \"starting with a no\" position \u2014 \u201cno, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d or \u201cno, FDA will never agree to that.\u201d\u00a0Rather, defining a \u201cwhat\u2019s possible\u201d approach provides the organization with flexibility as new data emerge, plans change, etc.  You know, normal drug development stuff!\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194360402464407552"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194374422609166336"}}},{"createdAt":1711454760000,"insightId":"54834987-5ad0-4e36-a644-8b9c1fe8a3f8","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7178361710632693760","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7178361710632693760","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7178361710632693760","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Very interesting topic"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:linkedInArticle:7178304951696121857"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7178306855415209985","message":{"attributes":[{"start":186,"length":8,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:synergy"}}},{"start":195,"length":4,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ceo"}}},{"start":200,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:regulatoryaffairs"}}}],"text":"Explore how CEO \/ C-suite synergy with Regulatory professionals can revolutionise your Life Sciences business.
