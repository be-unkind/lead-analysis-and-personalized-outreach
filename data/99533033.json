implantation. Recently, it has been appreciated that immune cells play a critical role in wound healing and tissue repair and should thus be considered as potentially beneficial particularly in the context of scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Here, we present a flow cytometric analysis of cellular recruitment to tissue-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds where we quantitatively describe the infiltration and polarization of several immune subtypes including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, and B cells. We define a specific scaffold-associated macrophage (SAM) that expresses CD11b+F4\/80+CD11c+\/-CD206hiCD86+MHCII+ that are characteristic of an M2-like cell (CD206hi) with high antigen presentation capabilities (MHCII+). Adaptive immune cells tightly regulate the phenotype of a mature SAM.

Encapsulation efficiencies of up to 74% were achieved for theoretical loadings from 1% to 10% (w\/w), with biphasic release over 85 days with nearly complete release at the end of this time course. About 1% salt was added to the formulations to examine its effects on doxycycline release; salt modulated release only by increasing the magnitude of initial release without altering kinetics. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated no characteristic differences between doxycycline-loaded and control spheres. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction suggest that there may be a molecular dispersion of the doxycycline within the spheres and the doxycycline may be in an amorphous state, which could explain the slow, prolonged release of the drug.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22263669","name":"Doxycycline delivery from PLGA microspheres prepared by a modified solvent removal method","publisher":"Journal of Microencapsulation","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXuwOkB4j3Q_pxZtb2PX2cEZ4xuKWU_GOk,NAME_SEARCH,Br0U)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAACzObQB9JBsokG0XLJraoqXUOaCBiBjU04,NAME_SEARCH,rlV9)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQFNfMBqhoKriLAQ71UVIaDP-cVWX7eXsg,NAME_SEARCH,1ZFC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXtLFwBFZRwC3xO3EGFr4SNT2hsA30F_g4,NAME_SEARCH,3vKM)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADP9ssBos_mv-faMHsduzeLD5EzUIpDw_4,NAME_SEARCH,Wd5O)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":23,"year":2018},"description":"Recent studies have reported that the immune system significantly mediates skeletal muscle repair and regeneration. Additionally, biological scaffolds have been shown to play a role in polarizing the immune microenvironment toward pro-myogenic outcomes. Moreover, myostatin inhibitors are known to promote muscle regeneration and ameliorate fibrosis in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a human disease characterized by chronic muscle degeneration. Biological scaffolds and myostatin inhibition can potentially influence immune-mediated regeneration in the dystrophic environment, but have not been evaluated together. Toward this end, here we created an injectable biological scaffold composed of hyaluronic acid and processed skeletal muscle extracellular matrix. This material formed a cytocompatible hydrogel at physiological temperatures in vitro. When injected subfascially above the tibialis anterior muscles of both wild-type and dystrophic mdx-5Cv mice, a murine model of DMD, the hydrogel spreads across the entire muscle before completely degrading at 3 weeks in vivo. We found that the hydrogel is associated with CD206+ pro-regenerative macrophage polarization and elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in both wild-type and dystrophic mice. Co-injection of both hydrogel and myostatin inhibitor significantly increased FoxP3+ regulatory T cell modulation and Foxp3 gene expression in the scaffold immune microenvironment. Finally, delivery of myostatin inhibitor with the hydrogel increased its bioactivity in vivo, and transplantation of immortalized human myoblasts with the hydrogel promoted their survival in vivo. This study identifies a key role for biological scaffolds and myostatin inhibitors in modulating a pro-regenerative immune microenvironment in dystrophic muscle.","url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2018\/08\/23\/jbc.RA118.004417","name":"Biological scaffold-mediated delivery of myostatin inhibitor promotes a regenerative immune response in an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy","publisher":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXuwOkB4j3Q_pxZtb2PX2cEZ4xuKWU_GOk,NAME_SEARCH,Br0U)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABUs0mMBFKRpa2omVUeYfi0SFZFrDLvm3Ow,NAME_SEARCH,0_nr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-ug7EBrvTtx_5HUPb8hARwVY6CCT2GD-w,NAME_SEARCH,bKkM)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABG01-4BjcgxYUH5dXqWV4B3e0PCK3VetuI,NAME_SEARCH,tHG-)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIPj78Bv7tTCHw5s9l97-2JWOjGfDCT4Yk, , )"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_qjYkBXAlJYkPOTAg7-P6zRY-gMvgH61c,NAME_SEARCH,4aMd)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAAb7-IBEpq25npAKBsz9pDaKfwfdXChXcI,NAME_SEARCH,1gbE)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACXdn8UBdlkMUYhuTmfLiYFlalF8aNyMAk8,NAME_SEARCH,m8BC)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":5,"year":2018},"description":"The time-dependent bioadhesive performance of various polymers was evaluated using a texture analyzer apparatus and freshly excised rat small intestinal tissue.

Bioadhesive force was characterized as a function of time relative to polycarbophil, a slightly cross-linked poly (acrylic acid)-derivative, revealing different fracture strengths and tensile work for each of the six backbone-side chain conjugations that were studied. While polycarbophil showed a rapid and significant loss of bioadhesion over the testing period, the newly developed synthetic polymers were able to maintain their bioadhesive performance over the course of 91\u2009min with the overall magnitude of bioadhesion corresponding to the hydrogen bonding potential of the associated side chains.
