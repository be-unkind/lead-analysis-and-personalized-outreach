{"summary":"I am a keen, conscientious, hard-working and reliable person. I am quick to grasp new ideas and concepts and develop innovative and creative solutions to problems. Able to work with little or no supervision and the ability to initiate and demonstrate the highest levels of motivation and commitment required to work in a fast moving, challenging environment.\n\nHaving appreciated working with the government of Malawi in one of the poorest districts in the country, it has proved that basis on theory does not always answer the reality of what is out there, but the practicality of turning theories into realistic change goals with respect to ethnicity, culture and social economic status within communities you are working in. The experience with my first degree, did actually put me to task on the perception of public health, that is there is more to public health which can be understood working within those areas of interest and reaching out other domains that relate public health. Having acquired my masters degree, it was a different ball game, now it was the addition of the knowledge from an international perspective to something realistic in my own country. I have appreciated the health care system in the United Kingdom, but realised Malawi can too sustain and maintain the same standards of health care. \n\nI believe understanding poverty and the social economic status of Malawians can definately not only help raise awareness but give the true picture of what communities in Malawi need. I believe there are fresh minds that can improve the health, economic environment of Malawi, but this can only be achieved through recognition and having the old minds play the advisory role and leave the implementation to the young minds. It should be known that as we develop so does the country of Malawi need fresh, energetic and passionate youths to build this country.","lastName":"Kasomekera","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:192070420","geoRegion":"Lilongwe, Central Region, Malawi, Malawi","fullName":"Taonga, Noel, Kasomekera","firstName":"Taonga, Noel,","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Partners In Health","description":"Contribute lessons from the NCD Synergies Network which is focused on fostering collaboration among countries addressing NCDs of extreme poverty through integrated health system design.\n\nProvision of administrative,  operational planning and program implementation experience to Ministry of Health and research efforts in partnership with the Lancet Commission on Reframing NCDs and Injuries for the Poorest Billion.
