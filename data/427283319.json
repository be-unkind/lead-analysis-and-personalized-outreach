There are presently no reliable ways to quantify beta cell mass in vivo, which hampers the understanding of the natural history of T1D and the development of novel therapies to preserve beta cell mass. To address this major unmet need, we have identified new potential beta cell biomarkers that are specific to beta cells with no or low expression in other human tissues. These novel biomarkers will be targeted by nanobodies, a single domain Camelidae (such as camels, llamas, and alpacas) antibody (sdAb). These nanobodies display unique features in respect to size, stability, and versatility. They are suitable to be labeled with different isotopes to produce tracers for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in animal models of cancer, immune disease or atherosclerosis and in the clinic. We are now, for the first time, using them for beta cell imaging. Initial data obtained in immune-deficient mice implanted with human beta cells indicated that the nanobodies clearly outperform peptides for in vivo imaging. Thus, in this project we intend to develop new nanobodies for beta- cell imaging and validate them in humanized mouse models of beta cell destruction, to allow the follow-up and quantification of beta

transplantation is an alternative approach for the treatment of severe forms of type 1 diabetes (T1D). To monitor the success of transplantation, it is desirable to follow the location of engrafted PIs non-invasively. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of transplanted PIs is a feasible cell tracking method; however, this requires labeling with a suitable contrast agent prior to transplantation. We have tested the feasibility of cationic magnetoliposomes (MLs), compared to commercial contrast agents (Endorem and Resovist), by labeling insulinoma cells and freshly isolated rat PIs. It was possible to incorporate Magnetic Ressonance (MR)-detectable amounts of MLs in a shorter time (4 h) when compared to Endorem and Resovist. MLs did not show negative effects on the PIs\u2019 viability and functional parameters in vitro. Labeled islets were transplanted in the renal sub-capsular region of healthy mice. Hypointense contrast in MR images due to the labeled PIs was detected in vivo upon transplantation, while MR detection of PIs labeled with Endorem and Resovist was only possible after the addition of transfection agents. These findings indicate that MLs are suitable to image PIs, without affecting their function, which is promising for future longitudinal pre-clinical and clinical studies involving the assessment of PI transplantation. \n\nKeywords: pancreatic islets; islet transplantation; MRI; contrast agents; magnetoliposomes; SPIOs; insulin; diabetes mellitus; cell imaging; transmission electron microscopy","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4426\/8\/1\/12\/htm","name":"Improved Labeling of Pancreatic Islets Using Cationic Magnetoliposomes","publisher":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABl303cBg1HSgPHs28lwR5lnj1C1ptnsiHQ,NAME_SEARCH,O_b7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":31,"year":2018},"description":"Magnetoliposomes (MLs) were synthesized and tested for longitudinal monitoring of transplanted pancreatic islets using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rat models. The rat insulinoma cell line INS-1E and isolated pancreatic islets from outbred and inbred rats were used to optimize labeling conditions in vitro. Strong MRI contrast was generated by islets exposed to 50 \u03bcg Fe\/ml for 24 hours without any increased cell death, loss of function or other signs of toxicity. In vivo experiments showed that pancreatic islets (50\u20131000 units) labeled with MLs were detectable for up to 6 weeks post-transplantation in the kidney subcapsular space. Islets were also monitored for two weeks following transplantation through the portal vein of the liver. Hereby, islets labeled with MLs and transplanted under the left kidney capsule were able to correct hyperglycemia and had stable MRI signals until nephrectomy. Interestingly, in vivo MRI of streptozotocin induced diabetic rats transplanted with allogeneic islets demonstrated loss of MRI contrast between 7\u201316 days, indicative of loss of islet structure. MLs used in this study were not only beneficial for monitoring the location of transplanted islets in vivo with high sensitivity but also reported on islet integrity and hereby indirectly on islet function and rejection.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/326720940_Magnetoliposomes_as_Contrast_Agents_for_Longitudinal_in_vivo_Assessment_of_Transplanted_Pancreatic_Islets_in_a_Diabetic_Rat_Model","name":"Magnetoliposomes as Contrast Agents for Longitudinal in vivo Assessment of Transplanted Pancreatic Islets in a Diabetic Rat Model","publisher":"Scientific Reports","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABl303cBg1HSgPHs28lwR5lnj1C1ptnsiHQ,NAME_SEARCH,O_b7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":29,"year":2019},"description":"Purpose: Magnetoliposomes (MLs) have shown great potential as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and as delivery vehicles for cancer therapy. Targeting the MLs towards the tumor cells or neovascularization could ensure delivery of drugs at the tumor site. In this study, we evaluated the potential of MLs targeting the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin overexpressed on tumor neovascularization and different tumor cell types, including glioma and ovarian cancer.\nMethods: MLs functionalized with a Texas Red fluorophore (anionic MLs), and with the fluorophore and the cyclic Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (cRGD; cRGD-MLs) targeting the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, were produced in-house. Swiss nude mice were subcutaneously injected with 107 human ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells. Tumors were allowed to grow for 3 weeks before injection of anionic or cRGD-MLs. Biodistribution of MLs was followed up with a 7T preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and fluorescence imaging (FLI) right after injection, 2h, 4h, 24h and 48h post injection. Ex vivo intratumoral ML uptake was confirmed using FLI, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and histology at different time points post injection.\nResults: In vivo, we visualized a higher uptake of cRGD-MLs in SKOV-3 xenografts compared to control, anionic MLs with both MRI and FLI. Highest ML uptake was seen after 4h using MRI, but only after 24h using FLI indicating the lower sensitivity of this technique. Furthermore, ex vivo EPR and FLI confirmed the highest tumoral ML uptake at 4 h. Last, a Perl\u2019s stain supported the presence of our iron-based particles in SKOV-3 xenografts.\nConclusion: Uptake of cRGD-MLs can be visualized using both MRI and FLI, even though the latter was less sensitive due to lower depth penetration. Furthermore, our results indicate that cRGD-MLs can be used to target SKOV-3 xenograft in Swiss nude mice. Therefore, the further development of this particles into theranostics would be of interest.","url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/targeting-tumor-cells-and-neovascularization-using-rgd-functionalized--peer-reviewed-article-IJN","name":"Targeting tumor cells and neovascularization using RGD-functionalized magnetoliposomes","publisher":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABl303cBg1HSgPHs28lwR5lnj1C1ptnsiHQ,NAME_SEARCH,O_b7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":23,"year":2019},"description":"Type 1 diabetes is characterised by a progressive decline in beta cell mass. This is also observed following implantation of pancreatic islet allografts, but there is no reliable information regarding the time course of beta cell loss. This is due to the limited availability of non-invasive pancreatic islet imaging techniques. We have previously described that dipeptidyl peptidase 6 (DPP6) is an alpha and beta cell-specific biomarker, and developed a camelid antibody (nanobody \u20184hD29\u2019) against it. We demonstrated the possibility to detect DPP6-expressing cells by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\/ computed tomography (CT), but the correlation between the number of cells grafted and the SPECT signal was not assessed. Here, we investigate whether the 4hD29 nanobody allows us to detect different amounts of human pancreatic islets implanted into immune-deficient mice. In addition, we also describe the adaptation of the probe for use with positron emission tomography (PET).","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00125-019-05068-5","name":"A nanobody-based nuclear imaging tracer targeting dipeptidyl peptidase 6 to determine the mass of human beta cell grafts in mice","publisher":"Diabetologia","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABl303cBg1HSgPHs28lwR5lnj1C1ptnsiHQ,NAME_SEARCH,O_b7)"}]},{"name":"A multimodal nanoprobe for pancreatic betacell detection and amyloidosis mitigation","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":20,"year":2020},"description":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease and a global health crisis. Due to the small mass and high dispersity of beta cells in the pancreas, especially among T2D patients, it remains a tremendous challenge to detect and image beta cell mass (BCM) in vitro and in vivo. Herein, a multimodal nanoprobe is constructed by surface functionalization of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with a two-photon fluorescent dye (NaP)-labelled polymer. Owing to the nanoparticle surface energy transfer (NSET) effect, the nanoprobe enabled pH-triggered fluorescence\/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the acidic beta cell environment. Specifically, confocal one-photon and two-photon modalities revealed prominent fluorescence in BTC-6 pancreatic beta cells among five major cell types, validating the probe as a sensor for BCM quantification. A kinetic assay, transmission electron microscopy and a viability assay further implicated the probe as a potent inhibitor against the aggregation and toxicity of human islet amyloid\npolypeptide (IAPP), the peptide associated with T2D. This probe presents a first multimodal theranostic system for imaging beta cell mass and inhibition of beta cell degeneration by IAPP amyloidosis.","publisher":"Chemistry of Materials","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABl303cBg1HSgPHs28lwR5lnj1C1ptnsiHQ,NAME_SEARCH,O_b7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":4,"year":2020},"description":"A common feature in the pathophysiology of different types of diabetes is the reduction of \u03b2 cell mass and\/or impairment of \u03b2 cell function.
