isolated from naturally occurring phytochemical sources. While some of these compounds have gone on to clinical use themselves, others have inspired the development of synthetic analogs, which might possess greater potency or better pharmacological features than the natural product itself. One such naturally occurring alkaloid, physostigmine, which is found in the Calabar bean plant Physostigma venenosum, has been demonstrated to be a potent cholinesterase inhibitor. However, some of physostigmine's characteristics limit its therapeutic potential, prompting the development of rivastigmine, a similarly structured synthetic compound. The research in our group focused on the synthetic optimization of rivastigmine and its analogs, utilizing computer modeling and biological assays to determine the most favorable analog for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) to terminate neuronal transmission and signaling between synapses. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease have lower levels of ACh, which has been associated with symptoms like memory impairment and confusion. The inhibition of AChE allows for ACh accumulation and continued signaling in parasympathetic nervous system. Through our studies, we determined that rivastigmine and its analogs were less effective at inhibiting AChE than physostigmine, and their biological activity is governed by sterics.","url":"https:\/\/emerginginvestigators.org\/articles\/22-070","name":"Modular mimics of neuroactive alkaloids - design, synthesis, and cholinesterase inhibitory activity of rivastigmine analogs","publisher":"Journal of Emerging Investigators","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADYrSCgBz9-OiofGRtTt83CGcQGIAFE1i5o,NAME_SEARCH,jj04)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":21,"year":2022},"description":"For centuries, neuroactive alkaloids isolated from naturally occurring phytochemical sources have been crucial in the identification and optimization of small molecules with potency in treating neurological disorders.

One such naturally occurring alkaloid, physostigmine, which is found in the calabar bean plant _Physostigma venenosum_, has been demonstrated to be a potent cholinesterase inhibitor.

Through such studies, it was determined that rivastigmine and its analogs were less effective at inhibiting AChE than physostigmine, and their biological activity is governed by sterics, prompting us to pursue three routes: the synthesis of S-enantiopure versions of our analogs, the synthesis of analogs with less steric hindrance, and the study of biological activity for all analogs on both cholinesterase enzymes to determine enzyme selectivity.","url":"https:\/\/acs.digitellinc.com\/p\/s\/modular-mimics-of-neuroactive-alkaloids-design-synthesis-cholinesterase-inhibitory-activity-and-sterics-study-of-novel-rivastigmine-analogs-poster-board-2703-515301","name":"Proceedings of the American Chemical Society Fall 2022 Intl.

Namely, andrographolide has been found to exert its biological activity through inhibition of Nf-kB, a transcription factor at the crossroads of a myriad of cell signaling pathways, including those pertaining to tumor survival and metastasis. Synthesis of derivatives of the natural product has the potential to create analogs and prodrugs of the compound that could improve tolerability, selectivity, and potency. Here we present the synthesis of C-ring modified andrographolide analogs with altered Michael acceptor properties, as well as a series of acid hydrolyzable acetal and ketal analogs, including efforts towards an andrographolide and antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which we assay for controlled delivery and release. We use a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay as a proxy for Nf-kB regulated gene expression.","url":"https:\/\/acs.digitellinc.com\/p\/s\/reactivity-informed-design-synthesis-and-targeted-delivery-of-andrographolide-and-analogs-nf-kb-regulated-natural-products-for-cancer-treatment-and-degenerative-diseases-poster-board-2801-515322","name":"Proceedings of the American Chemical Society Fall 2022 Intl.
