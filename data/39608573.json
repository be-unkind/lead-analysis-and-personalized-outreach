From the stained-glass brilliance of Saint-Chapelle to the inspiring historical preservation of antiquities at Basilique cath\u00e9drale Saint-Denis to the intricate sculptures of the Louvre, each location whispered stories of a bygone era where artistry thrived without the aid of modern technology. My journey began at Saint-Chapelle, a jewel box of a chapel. Sunlight streamed through the vast stained-glass windows, each panel a masterpiece depicting biblical scenes, but it wasn\u2019t just the grand scale that captivated me. Upon closer inspection, I\u2019ve noticed the meticulous details, the delicate shading in the Virgin Mary\u2019s robes, the intricate patterns on the angels\u2019 wings. These details, meant to be appreciated from afar, spoke volumes about the dedication of the artisans. They toiled for years, their only guide being their own meticulous vision and unwavering imagination. Next, I ventured to the imposing Saint-Denis Basilica, a final resting place for French royalty. Here, intricate stone carvings adorned the tombs, each depicting the deceased in exquisite detail \u2014 the folds of their clothing, the expressions on their faces. I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the sheer amount of time and skill required to create such work, especially considering the absence of power tools or 3D modeling software. While the De Cluny Museum boasts a treasure trove of artistic marvels, a hidden gem stole the show for me, the intricate wooden carvings! These unassuming sculptures, often relegated to the background, revealed a dedication to detail that goes beyond mere aesthetics. The focus wasn\u2019t just on the central figures, but even the most seemingly insignificant characters, perhaps miniature saints, were imbued with individuality. Their facial expressions weren\u2019t generic; they conveyed a spectrum of emotions, hinting at the inner lives of these miniscule figures. More interestingly, even background figures seemed to step out of the wood, not as idealized representations, but as real people of the era. This meticulous attention to detail speaks volumes about the artist\u2019s respect for humanity. Every figure, no matter how small, was worthy of being portrayed as an individual. It wasn\u2019t just about creating a grand narrative, but about weaving a tapestry of human experience within that narrative and of that era. This encounter with the wood carvings is a powerful reminder that greatness often lies in the seemingly insignificant details. It\u2019s a call to appreciate the richness of human experience, even in the most unexpected corners. It compels us to see the world not as a collection of archetypes, but as a vibrant tapestry of unique individuals, each with their own story to tell. The Louvre, of course, was a sensory overload of artistic treasures. From the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa to the breathtaking Winged Victory of Samothrace, each piece was a testament to the boundless imagination and technical mastery of the artists. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think that these awe-inspiring sculptures were brought to life with only rudimentary tools and the sheer force of human creativity.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@hashim.alzain\/parisian-grandeur-37cb629f6796","title":"Parisian Grandeur","sourceDomain":"medium.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":5}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7202207517353951234","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7202207517353951234","reactionsCount":5,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7202207516448010242","message":{"attributes":[{"start":728,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dRwuFYe8"}}},{"start":754,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:977787380"}}},{"start":768,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:804685207"}}}],"text":"Parisian Grandeur: How the Past Can Inspire Our Future in the City of Lights\n\nParis, the City of Lights, recently dazzled me not only with its iconic sights, but with the breathtaking detail hidden within its grand museums.

It\u2019s a real paradox: the very experiences that inflict pain on us often hold the key to unlocking our greatest potential. This brief article will explore the intriguing connection between pain and high achievement based on my personal experience, and how to transform those painful moments into your greatest advantage! Our bodies are wired to react to pain as a survival mechanism. It serves as a primal alert system, a biological red flag if you will that something needs attention and immediate action. In the context of pushing boundaries, this pain, whether physical or emotional, serves a crucial purpose that triggers a response, where it signals the need for adaptation and improvement. Here\u2019s where the pleasure connection emerges. Imagine an athlete pushing through a grueling workout regimen, where the burning muscles are a clear sign of pushing their limits. But within that discomfort lies a deeper truth: the body is adapting and growing stronger! When the athlete finally conquers that barrier, the sense of accomplishment is amplified tenfold. The pain becomes a badge of honor, a testament to the hard work invested instead of a bottomless pit of sorrow and remorse. Given the pain that we need to endure for us to reach to a better version of ourselves, how do we harness the power of pain to propel us forward? Here\u2019s a simple 3-step roadmap: I\u2019m known to reflect a lot of my actions and decisions, and there\u2019s a fascinating connection that I\u2019ve come to realize between pain and exceptional performance, and here are 3 reasons why I\u2019ve come to find a connection: By acknowledging the pain, learning from it, and embracing the discomfort of growth, you can turn painful experiences into steppingstones for exceptional performance. There are several reasons why exceptional performers throughout history have often endured repeated failures and have gone through many painful experiences: It all boils down to your worldview and how you perceive the world around you! Exceptional performers become so not because of the pain, but in spite of it. They learn to use the pain as fuel, transforming setbacks into steppingstones and develop the mental fortitude to overcome challenges and keep pushing forward. Here\u2019s another analogy for you to consider: Imagine a sculptor chipping away at a block of marble, where each chip is a small failure, a moment of discomfort, but with each chip, the vision becomes clearer, the masterpiece starts to emerge from the lifeless boring chunk of marble. The sculptor doesn\u2019t become exceptional because of the chipping, but despite the effort and the dust it creates. So, while pain is often a companion on the road towards exceptional performance, it\u2019s the exceptional individual\u2019s ability to learn from it and keep moving forward that truly sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. We become prisoners of our own thoughts if we allow them to take control over our lives, so be careful how you connect the dots of the painful experiences that you had to endure. Exceptional performance isn\u2019t about avoiding pain; it\u2019s about embracing it as a teacher. By acknowledging the pain, dissecting its source, and using it to fuel your growth, you can transform those difficult moments into the launchpad for your greatest achievements. Remember, the discomfort you experience today could be the catalyst that propels you past the competition tomorrow. So, don\u2019t shy away from the pain, instead, learn from it, leverage it, and rise above it. You\u2019ll always have some sort of conflict going on in your life, so you must learn to enjoy life while still solving them. Strangely, there\u2019s beauty in everything that we experience, so you need to adjust your perception about the world around you.

It depicted a burly lumberjack, muscles straining, meticulously carving a delicate female hand from a block of wood. But the scene wasn\u2019t idyllic. The background was a cold icy winter with daylight fading into the horizon. By gazing into the image, we can see the lumberjack not amidst the grandeur of a forest, but hunched over a tree trunk, muscles straining as he carves wood. Yet, the true weight he carries isn\u2019t physical. The lumberjack sculpts breathtaking figures; women, each with an ethereal beauty that seems to mock the workshop\u2019s cluttered reality. A half-eaten meal sits cold, a stark contrast to the life he breathes into the wood. You can almost sense the presence of a faded photograph somewhere under a pile of shavings, a glimpse of a smiling family; a wife, children, their faces etched with a happiness he seems to have missed. The artist\u2019s message is a gut punch. This lumberjack, a man of raw strength and evident talent, is trapped in a self-made prison. He dedicates himself to his craft, a workaholic driven by an insatiable hunger to perfect his art. The artist\u2019s message was clear just as it was haunting to me. This lumberjack, a sculptor by passion, was a man trapped in a paradox. He poured his heart into his art, yet the very act of creation seemed to isolate him from the life he was presumably building; a hot meal gone cold, a family yearning for attention. The lumberjack\u2019s masterpieces were born from his life of isolation. The unfinished meal speaks of long hours spent hunched over wood, the photograph of his family; a silent testament to neglected relationships. The lumberjack\u2019s eyes hold a deep sadness, a man yearning for connection even as his calloused hands create beauty from a distance. His story resonated with me so profoundly, especially during the early years of my startup company DarTec Engineering, where I nearly drove myself over the edge towards the brink of total disaster. The image sparked a reflection on the nature of workaholism. Why do some choose to spend a disproportionate amount of time focused on work, often at the expense of personal connections? These imageries of different lonely lumberjacks touch on a tender cord because it delves into the complexities of passion and purpose; two forces that drive my every action in life. So, I stopped and asked myself, is relentless pursuit of a calling worth the sacrifice of loved ones? The answer, of course, is far from simple. There can\u2019t be a single answer. Perhaps it\u2019s the pursuit of an elusive goal, the intoxicating thrill of achievement. Maybe it\u2019s a fear of failure, a relentless drive to prove their worth. Or it could be a coping mechanism, a way to escape personal struggles by burying themselves in work. Perhaps the lumberjack finds solace in his art, a form of escape from a life he feels he can\u2019t control. Maybe the faces he sculpts are a manifestation of the love and connection he craves but struggles to express. Or it could be a desperate attempt to immortalize the happiness he feels he\u2019s losing. The lumberjack artist work illustrations embody this internal conflict perfectly. He creates breathtaking pieces, channeling his raw strength into elegant forms, but the cost is a fractured personal life. The rendered images leave you wondering; is the finished model worth the lonely dinner and the yearning of his family? The images force us to confront the harsh realities of a workaholic lifestyle. While ambition is admirable, a life devoid of human connection is a hollow victory. The lumberjack\u2019s masterpieces are a testament to his talent, but the true cost lies in the neglected relationships around him. The artist\u2019s struggle is a cautionary tale for all of us. It\u2019s a reminder that true fulfillment lies in finding balance. We must nurture our passions, but never at the expense of the love that grounds us. The greatest works of art, after all, are not just the ones we create, but the lives we build and the memories we share. The lumberjack\u2019s story may be a work of fiction, but it leaves a lasting impression. It\u2019s a call to action, a plea to find harmony between our passions and our obligations. Let us strive for excellence, but never forget the beauty that lies outside the workshop; the warmth of a loved one\u2019s embrace, the laughter that fills a home. Only then can we truly create a masterpiece of a life. The lumberjack illustrations lingered in my mind long after I\u2019ve scrolled past them on my phone. It mirrored my own internal battle, a constant tug-of-war between following my calling and nurturing the ones I love. Like the sculptor, my work is my passion. Words flow through me, demanding to be shaped in the form of products, services, stories, articles, and scripts. It\u2019s a relentless drive, a fire that burns brightest within me during the quiet hours of the night when I\u2019m all alone, but the cost is steep! Every stolen hour to write becomes a missed dinner with my wife, a canceled night-out with friends, or forgetting to call people in my circles who\u2019re going through rough patches in their lives to remind them that I\u2019m here for them. The memories I yearn to build seem to slip through my fingers like sawdust. The guilt gnaws at me. Am I failing them, sacrificing their happiness for this self-imposed mission burden that I\u2019ve demanded of myself? My mind spins with justifications. I\u2019m creating something meaningful, leaving a legacy of amazing work that benefits many people around me and an inventory of words in the form of articles and book summaries on Medium for people to enjoy, so isn\u2019t that what truly matters? But a hollow echo answered back; what use is a legacy built on a foundation of fractured relationships? My family needs me present, not just providing for them. My wife craves my undivided attention, not the hurried \u201cI love you\u201d mumbled between keystrokes and rushed phone calls between meetings while on business travels. My friends miss the camaraderie, the shared laughter that fades with every canceled meet-up. Perhaps the answer doesn\u2019t lie in abandoning my passion altogether, but in finding a new rhythm. Maybe it\u2019s carving out dedicated writing hours outside of work, precious but finite, while fiercely guarding the rest for them. It could mean learning to say no to extra projects, prioritizing moments of connection over fleeting deadlines. The lumberjack artist serves as a reminder, a call to action. I won\u2019t let my passion become a prison, isolating me from the very people who inspire and ground me. I\u2019ll strive to find a balance, to be the artist who creates beautiful stories, but also the husband and friend who builds memories that will resonate long after the last word is written. The masterpiece, after all, isn\u2019t just on the page; it\u2019s the life we weave together.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@hashim.alzain\/the-lonely-lumberjack-d3b672f27e73","title":"The Lonely Lumberjack","sourceDomain":"medium.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":3},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1},{"type":"INTEREST","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7184979693798834176","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7184979693798834176","reactionsCount":5,"commentsCount":2,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7184979693090029568","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1216,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dNmWDvwk"}}}],"text":"The Lonely Lumberjack: When Your Passion Becomes Your Prison\n\nScrolling through my usual art feed on my phone, I stumbled upon a photo render by Tom Booth that stopped me dead in my tracks.

Happiness is a positive emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, contentment, and satisfaction. It can be brief or long-lasting, and it can be triggered by various experiences or events. Psychologists often differentiate between happiness as an emotion (feeling good) and life satisfaction (feeling good about your life as a whole), and I\u2019m not a psychologist, so I\u2019ll be addressing how I view happiness from a wholistic point of view in terms of life satisfaction. People have unique values, personalities, and life experiences that shape what brings them joy. What makes one person happy might not resonate with another, so here are some reasons why happiness varies from one person to another: There are a few reasons why many people look for happiness externally: Here\u2019s why finding happiness within is ultimately more fulfilling: Remember, finding happiness within doesn\u2019t mean isolating yourself. Strong relationships are important, but they should complement your inner well-being, not be the sole source of it. The journey to inner happiness involves self-discovery, cultivating gratitude, and building a life that reflects your values. It\u2019s an ongoing process, but it empowers you to create lasting joy from within. Growth often comes from overcoming challenges. While difficult experiences themselves might not be pleasurable, successfully navigating them can lead to a deeper sense of accomplishment, resilience, GRIT, and appreciation for the good times. The journey of self-discovery is crucial for understanding what truly brings you happiness. By exploring your values, passions, and goals, you gain a clearer picture of what a fulfilling life looks like for you. This self-awareness empowers you to make choices and pursue experiences that align with your unique definition of happiness. Remember, happiness is not a destination, but rather a journey. It\u2019s about appreciating the good times, learning from the bad ones, and cultivating a life that brings you a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Your \u201cWhy\u201d statement serves as a roadmap to your own happiness by providing clarity and direction. Here\u2019s how developing your \u201cWhy\u201d statement can help you find true happiness: Imagine you truly understand your \u201cWhy\u201d, your core purpose and motivations. Now, imagine all your actions and decisions stem from that understanding, what would your next move look like? You\u2019re no longer chasing short-lived pleasures or societal expectations. Instead, you\u2019re actively building a life that brings you meaning and fulfillment. This alignment between your \u201cWhy\u201d and your actions is the recipe for true finding your true happiness. Remember, your \u201cWhy\u201d statement is a living document, and it can evolve as you grow and experience life. The important thing is to take the time to explore what truly drives you and use that knowledge to create a life that sparks genuine happiness and is remembered long after you\u2019re gone\u2026 Create a Supportive Environment Remember, finding your why is a personal journey and there\u2019s no right or wrong answer, and it\u2019ll evolve over time. The key is to be introspective and identify what brings meaning and purpose to your life. By sharing your why and creating a supportive space, you can inspire others to embark on their own journey of self-discovery.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@hashim.alzain\/happiness-is-0d40ec2e32a3","title":"Happiness is\u2026","sourceDomain":"medium.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7181571245518315520","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7181571245518315520","reactionsCount":8,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7181571242448089088","message":{"attributes":[{"start":554,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dr3VEt3E"}}},{"start":580,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:2990682"}}},{"start":599,"length":7,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:84026723"}}},{"start":607,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:804685207"}}}],"text":"Happiness is\u2026\nWhy is Happiness so Elusive, Yet Hard to Find\n \nHappiness is a complex concept, and that's precisely why it can be so elusive.
