The design of clinical trials for bioequivalence of these biosimilars is hindered by the lack of information on variability of PK parameters to determine sample size of Ph I clinical trials. Use of PK modelling to estimate the variability of key bioequivalence PK parameters for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in order to perform sample size calculations is discussed. In addition the modeling of random subject\u2019s profiles can help to develop an optimal PK sampling schedule for mAbs to maximize the reliability of bioavailability comparisons between the reference medicinal product and biosimilar test formulation. Methods PK data obtained from the literature for 2 mAbs, bevacizumab and rituximab in separate studies, were used to develop the PK profiles. PK parameters that were derived both from population compartmental analysis (bevacizumab) and non-compartmental analysis (rituximab) were utilized for this purpose. The literature-based PK parameters were included in corresponding conversion equations for either 2-compartmental PK or simple log-linear non-compartmental models. These equations were then used to create simulated PK profiles for each mAb. Multiple PK profiles were created for each drug using a random combination of values for all parameters within their corresponding ranges of variability. The assay variability associated with the detection of drug concentration in the PK samples was applied to these profiles. The effect of individual parameter variability on the results was explored .  Resulting key PK parameters of each mAb were summarized using descriptive statistics to assess the variability of Cmax, AUCinf, etc. %CV for these parameters was calculated and used in sample size calculations for bioequivalence clinical studies.","url":"http:\/\/abstracts.aaps.org\/SecureView\/AAPSJournal\/radetzcv1l3.pdf","name":"PK Modeling of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) to Estimate Sample Sizes for Bioequivalence Studies of Biosimilar Candidates","publisher":"AAPS Annual Meeting 2015","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbxOGQBohtC00uqE8v4ERJvhvNv9x4grxI,NAME_SEARCH,91_o)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":30,"year":2021},"description":"Quantitative pharmacology brings important advantages in the design and conduct of pediatric clinical trials.

The model was then used via simulation to explore different dosing and sampling scenarios. Doses of 0.5 and 1.5 mg\/kg led to target exposures (i.e., similar to 25 and 100 mg of the reference product in adults) in all the reference pediatric ages (i.e., 2, 6, 12 and 17 years).

Full prescribing information for Breyanzi will be posted here . Efficacy was evaluated in TRANSCEND-MCL (NCT02631044), an open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who had received at least two prior lines of therapy including a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an alkylating agent, and an anti-CD20 agent. The trial included patients with an ECOG performance status of 1 or less, prior autologous and\/or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and secondary central nervous system lymphoma involvement. There was no prespecified threshold for blood counts; patients were eligible to enroll if they were assessed by the investigator to have adequate bone marrow function to receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Patients received a single dose of lisocabtagene maraleucel 2 to 7 days following the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg\/m 2 \/day and cyclophosphamide 300 mg\/m 2 \/day concurrently for 3 days). The primary efficacy analysis included a total of 68 patients with MCL who received at least 2 prior lines of therapy including a BTKi, had PET-positive disease at study baseline or after bridging therapy, received conforming product in the intended dose range, and had at least 6 months of follow-up from the date of first response. The main efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), defined as percentage of patients with best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after lisocabtagene maraleucel infusion, as determined by an independent review committee (IRC) using 2014 Lugano classification. Other efficacy measures included complete response rate (CRR) and duration of response (DOR), as determined by IRC. The ORR was 85.3% (95% CI: 74.6, 92.7) and the CRR was 67.6% (95% CI: 55.2, 78.5). After a median follow-up of 22.2 months (95% CI: 16.7, 22.8), the median DOR was 13.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 23.3). The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (\u2265\u00a020%) were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, encephalopathy, edema, headache, and decreased appetite. FDA approved lisocabtagene maraleucel with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy due to the risk of fatal or life-threatening CRS and neurologic toxicities. The recommended lisocabtagene maraleucel dose is 90 to 110 \u00d7 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells with a 1:1 ratio of CD4 and CD8 components. This review used the Assessment Aid , a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA\u2019s assessment. This application was granted priority review and orphan drug designation. FDA expedited programs are described in the\u00a0 Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics .

After a median follow-up of 22.2 months (95% CI: 16.7, 22.8), the median DOR was 13.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 23.3).\n#fda #oncology #genetherapy #drugapproval\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/gRU3_7X3"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7202279979110338560"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7202280361450496000"}}},{"createdAt":1716226800000,"insightId":"9c3aecbc-169d-4203-a54b-63f19caace19","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7198377157021061122","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7198377157021061122","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7198377156526186497","message":{"attributes":[],"text":""},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQErDXQAOAIfaA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1716219702321?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=2OyIRfnajF82XZxOvSQ2wkX7dsXazQ4hbXtoT1B9L14","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQErDXQAOAIfaA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1716219702321?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=2OyIRfnajF82XZxOvSQ2wkX7dsXazQ4hbXtoT1B9L14"}]},"description":"FDA approved Yesafili (aflibercept-jbvf) and Opuviz (aflibercept-yszy) as interchangeable biosimilars to Eylea (aflibercept).","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/lnks.gd\/l\/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZkYS5nb3YvZHJ1Z3MvbmV3cy1ldmVudHMtaHVtYW4tZHJ1Z3MvZmRhLWFwcHJvdmVzLWZpcnN0LWludGVyY2hhbmdlYWJsZS1iaW9zaW1pbGFycy1leWxlYS10cmVhdC1tYWN1bGFyLWRlZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1hbmQtb3RoZXItZXllP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyNDA1MjAuOTUwNTc3MjEifQ.wL92olQ55mt_xr_dgLPR3Jq3GCgzVJGCy5elyYuI8X4\/s\/3038929432\/br\/242753045153-l","title":"FDA approves first interchangeable biosimilars to Eylea to treat macul"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7198377056697552896","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1118,"length":4,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:fda"}}},{"start":1123,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:approval"}}},{"start":1133,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:biosimilar"}}},{"start":1145,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:interchangeable"}}},{"start":1162,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ophtalmic"}}},{"start":1173,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ga_z3pyR"}}}],"text":"FDA Approves First Interchangeable Biosimilars to Eylea\u00a0\nToday, FDA approved Yesafili (aflibercept-jbvf) and Opuviz (aflibercecpt-yszy) as the first interchangeable biosimilars to Eylea (aflibercept).

Full prescribing information for Enhertu will be posted here . Efficacy was evaluated in 192 adult patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who were enrolled in one of three multicenter trials: DESTINY-PanTumor02 (NCT04482309), DESTINY-Lung01 (NCT03505710), and DESTINY-CRC02 (NCT04744831). All three trials excluded patients with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD)\/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD\/pneumonitis at screening and clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for active brain metastases or ECOG performance status >1. Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure in all three trials was confirmed objective response rate (ORR), and an additional efficacy outcome was duration of response (DOR). All outcomes were assessed by independent central review (ICR) based on RECIST v1.1. In DESTINY-PanTumor02, ORR was 51.4% (95% CI: 41.7, 61.0) and median DOR was 19.4 months (range 1.3, 27.9+). In DESTINY-Lung01, ORR was 52.9% (95% CI: 27.8, 77.0) and median DOR was 6.9 months (range 4.0, 11.7+). In DESTINY-CRC02, ORR was 46.9% (95% CI: 34.3, 59.8), and DOR was 5.5 months (range 1.3+, 9.7+). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%), including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased white blood cell count, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, fatigue, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, vomiting, decreased appetite, alopecia, diarrhea,\u00a0 decreased blood potassium, constipation, decreased sodium, stomatitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. The prescribing information includes a Boxed Warning advising health professionals of the risk of interstitial lung disease and embryo-fetal toxicity. The recommended fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki dosage for this indication is 5.4 mg\/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This tumor agnostic indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). This review was conducted under\u00a0 Project Orbis , an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners. For this review, FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), Health Canada, and Singapore\u2019s Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The application reviews are ongoing at the other regulatory agencies. This review used the Assessment Aid , a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA\u2019s assessment. The FDA approved this application almost 2 months ahead of the FDA goal date. This application was granted Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. FDA expedited programs are described in the\u00a0 Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics .
