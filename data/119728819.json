GEHC is highlighting the system's HyperG gradient technology, which features 300 mT\/m and 750 T\/m\/s and supports detection of fine image details, according to the vendor. The company is also pointing to the scanner's high B-value diffusion and short echo times. Magnus is currently pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance. Many current GEHC 3-tesla systems will be upgradeable to Magnus when it becomes commercially available, according to the firm. \nThis advanced system offers superior gradient performance with its HyperG gradient technology, featuring 300 mT\/m and 750 T\/m\/s, enabling the detection of fine details that were previously unattainable. Researchers can fully utilize SIGNA MAGNUS capabilities to push the boundaries of advanced anatomical, diffusion and functional techniques, amplified by the latest deep-learning algorithms that GE HealthCare has to offer. SIGNA MAGNUS is designed to be a gateway to new research opportunities, helping to uncover new parameters and biomarkers with its vast potential. Its innovative asymmetric gradient design allows for remarkable diffusion performance, achieving extremely high B-value diffusion with short echo times (TEs), which further refines the understanding of neural architecture. Additionally, many GE HealthCare 3.0T systems are upgradable to SIGNA MAGNUS, which will help potential customers to save on capital costs.\nIn March 2024, the investigational MAGNUS system was successfully installed at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a leading research institution. The Brigham team will play a crucial collaborative role in performing research on high-performance neuro MR with GE HealthCare. \nThe vendor is also spotlighting Magnus at this week's annual meeting and exhibition of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) in Singapore."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7193942858649714688"}}},{"createdAt":1712331360000,"insightId":"3885a90a-6fc3-4a0c-a8cb-10086a15f722","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQGE6WxWa-Kj4A\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1712331417383?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=-JqNc_8KBqST0-iEPn6SB1Mb9RP8cFzzquCSgXoO8-g"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":27},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7182038518800519169","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7182038518800519169","reactionsCount":30,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7182038518045523968","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":4,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:mri"}}},{"start":5,"length":3,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ai"}}},{"start":9,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:artificialintelligence"}}},{"start":33,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:remotework"}}},{"start":45,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:radiology"}}}],"text":"#mri #ai #artificialintelligence #remotework #radiology"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7182038518045523968"}}},{"createdAt":1712088780000,"insightId":"07f57e4f-c5cc-42fc-8f51-fb59e0dacffb","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQEBsqyGJKgbqA\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1712088829911?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=r4Vjx4-OHnSfCbs418jIzMWwV83zLCDsAWZquy10q6E"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"PRAISE","count":35},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":2},{"type":"LIKE","count":666},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":26},{"type":"INTEREST","count":11}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7181021034203004929","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7181021034203004929","reactionsCount":740,"commentsCount":7,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7181021033347358720","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"The 11.7T MRI platform named Iseult was unveiled on April 2, 2024.

The MAGNETOM Terra.X is the successor to the MAGNETOM Terra, which debuted in 2017 as the world\u2019s first 7T clinical MR scanner, enabling extremely high-resolution imaging. An upgrade to the MAGNETOM Terra.X for installed MAGNETOM Terra systems was included in the FDA clearance, as was an upgrade for the MAGNETOM Terra to the XA60A software version.\n\n\u201cThe MAGNETOM Terra.X builds on our engineering achievements as pioneers in 7T MRI by providing the ultra-high-field community with the necessary tools to offer higher-quality patient care not just in neurological imaging, but also in the knee,\u201d said Katie Grant, vice president of Magnetic Resonance at Siemens Healthineers North America. \u201cAdditionally, this scanner supports key research initiatives pertaining to neurodegenerative disease, which is a major concern for our aging population.\u201d\n\nThe new Ultra IQ Technology of the MAGNETOM Terra.X introduces an unprecedented level of image quality for 7T scanning. The world\u2019s first clinical eight-channel parallel transmit architecture enables a degree of image clarity that reveals even extremely subtle pathological details.\n\nThe MAGNETOM Terra and MAGNETOM Terra.X with syngo MR XA60A software have Deep Resolve, the company\u2019s deep learning-based image reconstruction technology that has been trained specifically with 7T data to deliver new levels of speed and image resolution at 7T. For example, the combination of Deep Resolve and accelerated acquisition techniques such as high parallel acquisition can enable a routine high-resolution brain and knee exam in under 20 minutes, which is a dramatic improvement for 7T. Additionally, the scanner\u2019s new, high-performance gradient system delivers exceptional diffusion imaging and functional MR imaging.\n\nThe scanner\u2019s multinuclear option permits clinical imaging of substances in the body\u2014for example, sodium in the brain and phosphorous in muscle tissue\u2014that are not as easily visualized with standard MR field strengths. The ability to perform this type of imaging adds a metabolic component to the already exceptional anatomical imaging capabilities of 7T MR."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7178825417972191232"}}}]}
