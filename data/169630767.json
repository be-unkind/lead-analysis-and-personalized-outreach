In this study, a series of novel 2-mercaptobenzamide prodrugs were investigated for anti-HIV activity in the context of NCp7 inactivation. The molecules were synthesized from the corresponding thiosalicylic acids, and they are all crystalline solids and stable at room temperature. Derivatives with a range of amide side chains and aromatic substituents were synthesized and screened for anti-HIV activity. Wide ranges of antiviral activity were observed, with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 100\u2005\u03bcm depending on subtle changes to the substituents on the aromatic ring and side chain. Results from these structure\u2013activity relationships were fit to a probable mode of intracellular activation and interaction with NCp7 to explain variations in antiviral activity.

Wip1 dephosphorylates p53 as well as several kinases (such as p38 MAPK, ATM, Chk1, and Chk2) in the DNA damage response pathway that are responsible for maintaining genomic stability and preventing oncogenic transformation. As a result, Wip1 is an attractive target for synthetic inhibitors that could be further developed into therapeutics to treat some cancers. In this study, we report a series of alkyl-substituted N-methylaryl-N\u2032-aryl-4-aminobenzamides and their inhibitory activity of the Wip1 phosphatase. A straightforward synthetic route was developed to synthesize the target compounds from commercially available starting materials. Three different portions (R1, R2, R3) of the core scaffold were extensively modified to examine structure-activity relationships. This study revealed interesting trends about a new molecular scaffold to inhibit Wip1.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejmech.2022.114763","name":"Alkyl-substituted N-methylaryl-N\u2032-aryl-4-aminobenzamides: A new series of small molecule inhibitors for Wip1 phosphatase","publisher":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAocXC8BSUYzuXZyqwqZaV1EvWez5iZLlR8,NAME_SEARCH,sGgw)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2_mDUBH3RVe1kljj-Cpfw0pPJk4CGv09o,NAME_SEARCH,8srd)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAgSya0BjNAlvA8xQ49hoPPrpvjAVDuWUg8,NAME_SEARCH,GTx0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABEgv4YBPmCf8V3wcu-9ILYlC9SgyyBYJJ0,NAME_SEARCH,7LXd)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAB5rm5EBiKjQvh_FMlTSi3mp8hhb3c9RQJU,NAME_SEARCH,88BY)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":28,"year":2023},"description":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a formidable class of targeted biologics. Whereas all 11 Food and Drug Administration-approved ADCs are based on random conjugation, accumulating evidence suggests a potential for improved therapeutic index with site-specific ADCs. Here, we present a two-step sequential conjugation approach that marries the site specificity of the bacterial transglutaminase (TG) reaction with the robustness of Diels-Alder (DA) chemistry to generate stable antibody conjugates with favorable physiochemical properties. Further, we identify diene-based linkers with different reaction kinetics for DA coupling, and we use these linker derivatives to conjugate antibodies to two distinct small molecules in tandem. In addition, we show strong potency of antibody conjugates, prepared via TG-DA chemistry, in both cell-based assays and a mouse model. Overall our conjugation approach is site specific, versatile, and can potentially be used to generate different classes of antibody conjugates for multiple therapeutic areas.","url":"https:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports-physical-science\/fulltext\/S2666-3864(23)00341-7#%20","name":"Site-specific antibody conjugations using bacterial transglutaminase and the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction","publisher":"Cell Reports Physical Science","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAocXC8BSUYzuXZyqwqZaV1EvWez5iZLlR8,NAME_SEARCH,sGgw)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAH8b1QBlhPD51LrGHAiUVJPBs-OJhQ9aJA,NAME_SEARCH,DZJO)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHHo30B8FtAAvDi26eqy6_rUESe6k_KOFg,NAME_SEARCH,rer3)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAU-cycBRgrF-9-R1Mmj0qkPweBzUej6vMI,NAME_SEARCH,igAs)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAARQrAwBqvn3FPwbESRQ0Txqv5ekLuNm9Q0,NAME_SEARCH,vc1b)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABTAgmUBM6GS8ptQ7TCykBaxsopTHnEALZI,NAME_SEARCH,Sf-4)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA32KKUBuxCvlCZV-b0s2ev9dTV9HSa_8_4,NAME_SEARCH,MP0d)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBjDuUBSjx5uZRt0brBCyi0wIYaPjjEiig,NAME_SEARCH,yeJU)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA5K4LoBygWWhB4d2rJ8oBnsA1U3s1zrmYk,NAME_SEARCH,3-D0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOCYUcBmgIfEKjWOkyVl4HFQkqXUAR1J1U,NAME_SEARCH,eQSQ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEdaQ0BYcpBiqbdJyY9RuATG03j5X1MbiM,NAME_SEARCH,eTEA)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":23,"year":2023},"description":"For a number of years, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been a critical issue for humanity.

Did my PhD for 5 years at MIT, and have also visited Stanford. I am also a graduate from IIT Madras, so you can trust me when I write this answer.\n\n(1) Students: At\u00a0MIT\u00a0and\u00a0Stanford,\u00a0all students I interacted with were extremely passionate about what they were studying. They loved what they did so much that you could see the enthusiasm on their face and in their work. They didn't come there because they were forced, it was their choice. \n\nIn\u00a0Indian universities,\u00a0you just don't see the fire in most of the students. It's missing.They just drag themselves half heartedly to finish their course as if they were forced to do it. If the fire is missing in the students that make the university, how can the university be great?\n\n(2) Professors: Indian professors have a secure job. In universities like\u00a0MIT\u00a0and\u00a0Stanford,\u00a0professors have to work really hard to keep their job and get tenure. Their research work and teaching has to be really great for them to keep their job.\n\nIn India however, how many times have you heard a professor was fired due to\u00a0bad teaching or low quality research? Doesn't this job security itself lead to mediocrity? Then how do you expect our universities to be great? \n\n(3) Diversity: MIT and Stanford attract talent from all over the world. This really makes the peer group you have unparalleled. You can have a business consultant, a solar panel expert, a rocket enthusiast and a traveller in the same room( My own experience). \n\nIn\u00a0Indian universities, students don't really know what their passion is. This might be due to the broken engineering entrance examination system and the pressure it puts on students. They find out their passion in those 4 years of engineering. Mostly they are not interested in their field of choice and go on to do different things. If the peer group is not great, then how can the universities be great?\n\n(4) Funding: If a laser is broken in an\u00a0Indian lab, it takes 2\u20133 months to repair it. Till then, the student has to wait. Two months wasted. If a laser is broken in an MIT\/Stanford lab, they have 3 more of the same type ready. No time is wasted! \n\nIf the government doesn't increase the funding to match that of the best universities in the world, how can you expect the universities to be great?\n\n(5) Improvements: To all the points above, there are of course exceptions. There are some top notch professors and research labs in India too. But don't you think some systemic changes are needed: \n\n- Branch selection not based on rank, but based on choice.\n- Tenure track system for professors.\n- Increased international collaborations to increase student diversity on campus.\n- Increased private\/public funding to universities.\n\nP.S: If interested in content like this, we run a free newsletter for several aspects of the education system.
