This requires frequent glycaemia monitoring, and the gold standards for this are fingerstick tests. During the last decades, several blood-withdrawal-free platforms have been being studied to replace this test and to improve significantly the quality of life of people with diabetes (PWD). Devices estimating glycaemia level targeting blood or biofluids such as tears, saliva, breath and sweat, are gaining attention; however, most are not reliable, user-friendly and\/or cheap. Given the complexity of the topic and the rise of diabetes, a careful analysis is essential to track scientific and industrial progresses in developing diabetes management systems. Here, we summarize the emerging blood glucose level (BGL) measurement methods and report some examples of devices which have been under development in the last decades, discussing the reasons for them not reaching the market or not being really non-invasive and continuous. After discussing more in depth the history of Raman spectroscopy-based researches and devices for BGL measurements, we will examine if this technique could have the potential for the development of a user-friendly, miniaturized, non-invasive and continuous blood glucose-monitoring device, which can operate reliably, without inter-patient variability, over sustained periods.","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fchem.2022.994272\/full","name":"Is Raman the best strategy towards the development of non-invasive continuous glucose-monitoring devices for diabetes management?","publisher":"Front.

Here we present and make available tools to fully exploit this potential, in particular by coding via hue, saturation, and intensity the phasor positions and their weights both in the phasor plot and in the microscope image. We apply these tools to analyze FLIM data acquired via two-photon microscopy to visualize: (i) different phases of the drug pioglitazone (PGZ) in solutions and\/or crystals, (ii) the position in the phasor plot of non-labelled poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), and (iii) the effect of PGZ or PGZ-containing NPs on the metabolism of insulinoma (INS-1 E) model cells. PGZ is recognized for its efficacy in addressing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and polymeric nanoparticles offer versatile platforms for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and controlled release kinetics. This study lays the foundation for a better understanding via phasor-FLIM of the organization and effects of drugs, in particular, PGZ, within NPs, aiming at better control of encapsulation and pharmacokinetics, and potentially at novel anti-diabetics theragnostic nanotools.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/molecules29092137","name":"Pioglitazone Phases and Metabolic Effects in Nanoparticle-Treated Cells Analyzed via Rapid Visualization of FLIM Images","publisher":"Molecules","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABvQYr0BqByhKCWFKPWIMv1Eeo7QbeRCT68,NAME_SEARCH,PKQa)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFJp2wBx9B0Y41DF_OC-kGm6jnKe7jqryo,NAME_SEARCH,aVhb)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715224740000,"insightId":"029393a2-4121-496d-93ae-2179fda17cf5","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:celebrateJobChange:7194174179884081153"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":47},{"type":"PRAISE","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194174180441952257","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194174180441952257","reactionsCount":55,"commentsCount":26,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194174180441952257","message":{"attributes":[{"length":9,"start":88,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:13476"}}}],"text":"I\u2019m happy to share that I\u2019m starting a new position as Hematology Account Specialist at Regeneron!"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194174180441952257"}}},{"createdAt":1710445260000,"insightId":"49342218-4f36-4308-9966-9aaba93509ad","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7173742004391071744,7174127610732408832)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7173742004391071744","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Why have I still not done pre-check yet?!! :) gotta get on that, thanks for the reminder lady! ;)"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7173742004391071744"}}}]}
