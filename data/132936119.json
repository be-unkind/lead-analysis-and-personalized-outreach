To extend this concept to other tumor-targeting proteins, we conjugated the tubulin inhibitor monomethyl-auristatin-F (MMAF) to 2.5F\u2013Fc, a fusion protein composed of a human Fc domain and a cystine knot (knottin) miniprotein engineered to bind with high affinity to tumor- associated integrin receptors. The broad expression of integrins (including avb3, avb5, and a5b1) on tumor cells and their vasculature makes 2.5F-Fc an attractive tumor-targeting protein for drug delivery. We show that 2.5F-Fc can be expressed by cell- free protein synthesis, during which a non-natural amino acid was introduced into the Fc domain and subsequently used for site-specific conjugation of MMAF through a noncleavable\nlinker. The resulting knottin\u2013Fc\u2013drug conjugate (KFDC), termed 2.5F-Fc-MMAF, had approximately 2 drugs attached per KFDC. 2.5F\u2013Fc\u2013MMAF inhibited proliferation in human glioblastoma (U87MG), ovarian (A2780), and breast (MB-468) cancer cells to a greater extent than 2.5F\u2013Fc or MMAF alone or added in combination. As a single agent, 2.5F\u2013Fc\u2013MMAF was effective at inducing regression and prolonged survival in U87MG tumor xenograft models when administered at 10 mg\/kg two times per week. In comparison, tumors treated with 2.5F\u2013Fc or MMAF were nonresponsive, and treatment with a nontargeted control, CTRL\u2013Fc\u2013MMAF, showed a modest but not significant therapeutic effect. These studies provide proof- of-concept for further development of KFDCs as alternatives to ADCs for tumor targeting and drug delivery applications.

The impact of\nS. pneumoniae on host molecular processes that lead to detrimental\npulmonary consequences is not fully understood. Here, we show that\nS. pneumoniae induces toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in\nhuman alveolar epithelial cells, as indicated by ataxia telangiectasia\nmutated kinase (ATM)-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX\nand colocalization with p53-binding protein (53BP1). Furthermore, results\nshow that DNA damage occurs in a bacterial contact-independent\nfashion and that Streptococcus pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), which\nenables synthesis of H2O2, plays a critical role in inducing DSBs. The\nextent of DNA damage correlates with the extent of apoptosis, and\nDNA damage precedes apoptosis, which is consistent with the time\nrequired for execution of apoptosis. Furthermore, addition of catalase,\nwhich neutralizes H2O2, greatly suppresses S. pneumoniae-induced\nDNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, S. pneumoniae induces DSBs\nin the lungs of animals with acute pneumonia, and H2O2 production\nby S. pneumoniae in vivo contributes to its genotoxicity and virulence.\nOne of the major DSBs repair pathways is nonhomologous end joining\nfor which Ku70\/80 is essential for repair. We find that deficiency of\nKu80 causes an increase in the levels of DSBs and apoptosis, underscoring\nthe importance of DNA repair in preventing S. pneumoniaeinduced\ngenotoxicity. Taken together, this study shows that\nS. pneumoniae-induced damage to the host cell genome exacerbates\nits toxicity and pathogenesis, making DNA repair a potentially important\nsusceptibility factor in people who suffer from pneumonia.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26080406","name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae secretes hydrogen peroxide leading to DNA damage and apoptosis in lung cells.","publisher":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA9kDSEB1x_dsSyif5CVT8huUXWukvmqsEY,NAME_SEARCH,8vQG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPEppMBwE2OuR4ryjP6kSyYfyAJDJnhN9s,NAME_SEARCH,WdbU)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA6MaRABuodCCcdlcMbs7BaK_bC76hwTdVk,NAME_SEARCH,qh1X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAfscbcBTUy5YTHhH-gWN3yN2umAYozM90Y,NAME_SEARCH,nn5o)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEu8WQBYXBldem1xZCBoQTPUZHtMTwjm7M,NAME_SEARCH,tgBb)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"year":2014},"description":"Tumors of the central nervous system are challenging to treat due to the limited effectiveness and associated toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. For tumors that can be removed surgically, extent of malignant tissue resection has been shown to correlate with disease progression, recurrence, and survival. Thus, improved technologies for real-time brain tumor imaging are critically needed as tools for guided surgical resection. We previously engineered a novel peptide that binds with high affinity and unique specificity to \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1V\u03b25, and \u03b15\u03b21 integrins, which are present on tumor cells, and the vasculature of many cancers, including brain tumors. In the current study, we conjugated this engineered peptide to a near infrared fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 680), and used the resulting molecular probe for non-invasive whole body imaging of patient-derived medulloblastoma xenograft tumors implanted in the cerebellum of mice. The engineered peptide exhibited robust targeting and illumination of intracranial medulloblastoma following both intravenous and intraperitoneal injection routes. In contrast, a variant of the engineered peptide containing a scrambled integrin-binding sequence did not localize to brain tumors, demonstrating that tumor-targeting is driven by specific integrin interactions. Ex vivo imaging was used to confirm the presence of tumor and molecular probe localization to the cerebellar region. These results warrant further clinical development of the engineered peptide as a tool for image-guided resection of central nervous system tumors.

However, TLR agonists present toxicities associated with widespread immune activation after systemic administration. To design a TLR-based therapeutic suitable for systemic delivery and capable of safely eliciting tumor-targeted responses, we developed immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) comprising a TLR7\/8 dual agonist conjugated to tumor-targeting antibodies. Systemically administered human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted ISACs were well tolerated and triggered a localized immune response in the tumor microenvironment that resulted in tumor clearance and immunological memory. Mechanistically, ISACs required tumor antigen recognition, Fc\u03b3-receptor-dependent phagocytosis and TLR-mediated activation to drive tumor killing by myeloid cells and subsequent T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. ISAC-mediated immunological memory was not limited to the HER2 ISAC target antigen since ISAC-treated mice were protected from rechallenge with the HER2\u2212 parental tumor.
