Assessment of route options on a gram scale demonstrated that the Dimroth rearrangement is a viable approach. The processes were then evolved for large-scale production with learning from a kilo campaign and two plant-scale manufactures.

Analogous neutral five membered azaborole derivatives are possible if an additional carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom like (X = O, N or S), thus giving X\u2013B\u2013N or X\u2013N\u2013B type of molecular framework with a potential for aromatic stabilization, novel physicochemical and pharmacological properties. These five membered azaborole have proven difficult to synthesize. In this paper a computational analysis on the viability (based on relative stability, aromaticity, electrophilic\/nucleophilic reactivity, 11B and 1H NMR chemical shifts, solvent effect, proton affinity, hydrolysis, dimerization and trimerization potential of X\u2013B\u2013N and X\u2013N\u2013B azaboroles) is performed. Decomposition of isomer stabilization energy (ISE) into \u03c3 bond energy and aromatic stabilization energy was found useful in explaining differences between X\u2013B\u2013N and X\u2013N\u2013B systems. Results predict that X\u2013B\u2013N framework is more stable than the X\u2013N\u2013B, however the latter retains a considerable amount of aromatic character. Azaboroles are found to be less basic than ammonia. Stepwise hydrolysis involving protonation at N of B\u2013N moiety followed by attack of water or hydroxide ion and liberation of hydrogen is more feasible than a concerted mechanism. Tautomers are less stable than parent azaboroles except for 1,2,3-diazaborole (3). Thus, X\u2013N\u2013B and X\u2013B\u2013N type of five membered azaboroles are viable under dry conditions, and have an unexplored potential as novel building blocks towards the synthesis of new drug-like molecules and materials.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2017\/nj\/c7nj00950j#!divAbstract","name":"CQC\/B\u2013N substitution in five membered heterocycles.

In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron-neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen-substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation. Overall, our work rehabilitates electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane as a valuable strategy for accessing functionalised BCPs.","url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/anie.202111291","name":"Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen-Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes","publisher":"Wiley","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAk3LGgBGOTizHC9VXi7hZz9VMNLmAtLA04,NAME_SEARCH,2XlC)"}]},{"name":"Galactose Oxidase Enables Modular Assembly of Conjugates from Native Antibodies with High Drug-to-Antibody Ratios","publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":21,"year":2021},"description":"The potential of antibody conjugates with high drug loading in anticancer therapy has recently been highlighted by the approval of Trastuzumab deruxtecan and Sacituzumab govitecan. These biopharmaceutical approaches have spurred interest in bioconjugation strategies with high and defined degrees antibody-to-drug (DAR) ratios, in particular on native antibodies. Here we report a glycoengineering methodology to generate antibody drug conjugates with DAR of up to eight, by combining highly selective enzymatic galactosylation and oxidation with biorthogonal tandem Knoevenagel-Michael addition chemistry. This three step approach offers a selective route to conjugates from native antibodies with high drug loading, and thus illustrates how biocatalysis can be used for the generation of biopharmaceuticals using mild reaction conditions.","url":"https:\/\/chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.202102592","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAk3LGgBGOTizHC9VXi7hZz9VMNLmAtLA04,NAME_SEARCH,2XlC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABenoUIBDx6fQC9r-VJ_umAO12b-z_z6Kdo,NAME_SEARCH,CSqM)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABsu1ssB9XpkhEcqufrTiDPkRHN6Y1n8fhg,NAME_SEARCH,xdyy)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":24,"year":2021},"description":"For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2-amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C\u2212C bond-forming hydrogen-borrowing alkylation reactions.
