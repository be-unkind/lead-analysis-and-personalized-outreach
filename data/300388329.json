The aim of this study was to assess the role of magnetic resonance dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging (DSC-MRI) with histogram analysis in the prognostic evaluation of patients suffering from glioblastoma. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight patients with newly diagnosed pathologically verified GBM were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent MRI investigations, including DSC-MRI, surgical procedure and received postoperative focal radiotherapy plus daily temozolomide (TMZ), followed by adjuvant TMZ therapy. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) histograms were generated from a volume of interest covering the solid portions of the tumor and statistically evaluated for kurtosis, skewness, mean, median and maximum value of rCBV. To verify if histogram parameters could predict survival at 1 and 2 years, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate patient's overall survival. Results: rCBV kurtosis and rCBV skewness showed significant differences between subjects surviving > 1 and > 2 years, According to ROC analysis, the rCBV kurtosis showed the best statistic performance compared to the other parameters; respectively, values of 1 and 2.45 represented an optimised cut-off point to distinguish subjects surviving over 1 or 2 years. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference between subjects with rCBV kurtosis values higher or lower than 1 (respectively 1021 and 576 days; Log-rank test: p = 0.007), and between subjects with rCBV kurtosis values higher or lower than 2.45 (respectively 802 and 408 days; Log-rank test: p = 0.001).

In particular, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a progressive sclerotic-myxedematous systemic disease of unknown etiology, is related to gadolinium-based contrast agent administration in patients with kidney dysfunction. More recently, evidence of magnetic resonance signal intensity changes on pre-contrast T1-weighted images after multiple gadolinium-based contrast agent administrations resulted in the hypothesis of gadolinium brain accumulation in patients with normal renal function, subsequently confirmed in pathological samples. However, there is limited current data and further investigations are necessary before drawing definite conclusions on the clinical consequences of gadolinium-based contrast agent accumulation in human tissues and particularly in the brain. Gadolinium-based contrast agent-related toxicity appears connected to molecular stability, which varies together with the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound and depends on the individual characteristics of the subject. During a lifetime, the physiological changes occurring in the human body may influence its interaction with gadolinium-based contrast agents: the integrity and developmental stage of the organs has an effect on the dynamics of gadolinium-based contrast agent distribution and excretion, thus leading to different possible mechanisms of deposition and toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this work is to discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gadolinium-based contrast agents, with a special focus on the brain, and to explore potential predominant gadolinium-based contrast agent-related toxicity in two cornerstone periods of the human life cycle: fetal\/neonatal and adulthood\/aged.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/323565266_Gadolinium-Based_Contrast_Agent-Related_Toxicities","name":"Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent-Related Toxicities","publisher":"CNS Drugs ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"year":2018},"description":"In the last few years, several scientific papers and reports have demonstrated magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity (SI) changes on pre-contrast T1-weighted images following multiple gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) administrations, particularly following the exposure to linear GBCAs.

A mixed linear model was used to evaluate the effects on signal intensity ratios of the number of GBCA administrations, the time interval between administrations, age, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Differentiating diagnoses between therapy-associated brain injury and recurrent disease can be difficult, and the immediate recognition of neurotoxicity is crucial to providing correct therapeutic management, ensuring damage reversibility. For these purposes, the knowledge of clinical timing and specific treatment protocols is extremely important for interpreting MRI patterns. Neuroradiologic findings are heterogeneous and sometimes overlapping, representing the compounding effect of the different treatments. Moreover, MRI patterns can be acute, subacute or delayed and involve different brain regions, depending on (1) the mechanism of action of the specific medication and (2) which brain regions are selectively vulnerable to specific toxic effects.

It has been recently hypothesized that restricted diffusivity in HGG may be related to hypoxic\/ischemic changes inside the tumor. We therefore investigated the differences of ADC values between areas with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) markers of hypoxia and necrosis (lactate and lipid compounds) and regions with lack of both metabolites. Methods: The MRS datasets and the corresponding ADC maps of 28 patients with HGG were retrospectively reviewed. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on ADC maps by means of spectral characteristics, considering the solid portions of gliomas. One-way ANOVA or Welch test were performed for multiple comparison of the Mean ADC, minimum ADC (minADC), and standard deviation of pixel-by-pixel ADC measurements (ADC SD) values among the groups of ROIs with lactate, lipids, and lack of both metabolites (LAC, LIP, and NEG group, respectively). Results: The minADC values in LAC group (908 \u00b1 161 \u00d7 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) ) were found to be significantly (P = .03) higher than in NEG group (792 \u00b1 122 \u00d7 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) ). We did not find other significant differences by the multiple comparison tests. Conclusions: HGG areas with MRS markers of hypoxia and necrosis are not associated with restricted diffusivity. To explain the trend to diffusion facilitation in HGG lactate-expressing regions, we hypothesize a possible hypoxia-induced volume reduction of glioma cells with extracellular shift of cytoplasmic water.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/301331959_Relationship_between_Apparent_Diffusion_Coefficients_and_MR_Spectroscopy_Findings_in_High-Grade_Gliomas_Relationship_between_ADC_and_Spectroscopy_in_Gliomas","name":"Relationship between Apparent Diffusion Coefficients and MR Spectroscopy Findings in High-Grade Gliomas: Relationship between ADC and Spectroscopy in Gliomas","publisher":"Journal of neuroimaging: official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":22,"year":2020},"description":"Spinal cord involvement in Kearns-Sayre (KSS) syndrome could be more frequent than commonly thought.

Our aim was to develop a GBM-tailored deep-learning model for IDH prediction by applying convoluted neural networks (CNN) on multiparametric MRI. We selected 100 adult patients with pathologically demonstrated WHO grade IV gliomas and IDH testing. MRI sequences included: MPRAGE, T1, T2, FLAIR, rCBV and ADC. The model consisted of a 4-block 2D CNN, applied to each MRI sequence. Probability of IDH mutation was obtained from the last dense layer of a softmax activation function. Model performance was evaluated in the test cohort considering categorical cross-entropy loss (CCEL) and accuracy. Calculated performance was: rCBV (accuracy 83%, CCEL 0.64), T1 (accuracy 77%, CCEL 1.4), FLAIR (accuracy 77%, CCEL 1.98), T2 (accuracy 67%, CCEL 2.41), MPRAGE (accuracy 66%, CCEL 2.55). Lower performance was achieved on ADC maps. We present a GBM-specific deep-learning model for IDH mutation prediction, with a maximal accuracy of 83% on rCBV maps. Highest predictivity achieved on perfusion images possibly reflects the known link between IDH and neoangiogenesis through the hypoxia inducible factor.","url":"https:\/\/res.mdpi.com\/d_attachment\/jpm\/jpm-11-00290\/article_deploy\/jpm-11-00290-v2.pdf","name":"Deep Learning Can Differentiate IDH-Mutant from IDH-Wild GBM","publisher":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":10,"year":2020},"description":"The Ketogenic Diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been utilized as the firstline treatment for contrasting intractable epilepsy.

Clinical data, medical history, and therapies administered at the time of PRES and laboratory findings were reviewed as the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at PRES presentation and during follow-up. Statistics included Mann\u2013Whitney U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. A total of 39 pediatric patients (25 males, median age = 8.8 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of PRES were included. The patients were divided into four groups based on the underlying disease: (1) patients with hemato-oncological diseases not transplanted (n = 15, 38.5%), (2) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; n = 12, 30.8%), (3) affected by renal (n = 8, 20.5%), and (4) by autoimmune diseases (n = 4, 10.2%). Hemato-oncological patients and those undergoing HSCT presented a higher incidence of involvement of deep gray matter structures and hemorrhagic lesions when compared with patients with renal and autoimmune disorders (p = 0.036 and p = 0.036, respectively). No differences emerged among different groups of patients regarding presenting PRES symptoms, arterial blood pressure, laboratory findings, and extent of MRI abnormalities and these parameters did not show association with outcome. In conclusion, in pediatric patients with different diseases who develop PRES, involvement of deep gray matter structures and hemorrhagic lesions are more common in hemato-oncological patients and those undergoing HSCT. Clinical and radiologic outcome is favorable independently of clinical data and extent of MRI abnormalities.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/343455495_Multifactorial_Posterior_Reversible_Encephalopathy_Syndrome_in_Children_Clinical_Laboratory_and_Neuroimaging_Findings","name":"Multifactorial Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in Children: Clinical, Laboratory, and Neuroimaging FindingsMultifactorial Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in Children: Clinical, Laboratory, and Neuroimaging Findings","publisher":"Journal of pediatric neurology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":1,"year":2020},"description":"Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II is a rare disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia, severe proportionate short stature, insulin resistance and cerebrovascular abnormalities including cerebral aneurysms and moyamoya disease. MOPD type II is caused by mutations in the pericentrin (PCNT ) gene, which encodes a protein involved in centrosomes function. We report a 2 year old girl affected by MOPD type II caused by two compound heterozygous loss\u2010of\u2010function variants in PCNT gene, of which one is a novel variant (c.5304delT; p.Gly1769AlafsTer34). The patient presented atypical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings consistent with pachygyria. This was confirmed by morphometric analysis of cortical thickness (CT) and gyrification index by comparing MRI data of the patient with a group of eight age\u2010matched healthy controls. The statistical analysis revealed a significant and diffuse increase of CT with an anterior\u2010predominant pattern and diffuse reduced gyrification (p < .05). These findings provide new evidences to the emergent concept that malformations of cortical development are complex disorders and that new genetic findings contribute to the fading of classification borders.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/343407413_Microcephalic_osteodysplastic_primordial_dwarfism_type_II_and_pachygyria_Morphometric_analysis_in_a_2-year-old_girl","name":"Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II and pachygyria: Morphometric analysis in a 2\u2010year\u2010old girl","publisher":"American Journal of Medical Genetics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":4,"year":2019},"description":"Purpose: Kearns Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial disorder characterized by development of visual impairment. Electroretinogram (ERG) and visual evoked potentials are not able to provide topographical information of optic damage. The purpose of this study was to explore retrochiasmatic optic pathway alteration in KSS with diffusion tractographic analysis and to compare it with different tracts. Methods: DTI from 8 KSS subjects (14.7 years) and 10 healthy controls (HC) were acquired on a 3T scanner. Optic radiations (OR), optic tracts (OT), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) and corticospinal tract (CST) were reconstructed with probabilistic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were calculated, evaluating group differences. T test on diffusion parameters identified significantly different track portions among cohorts. Results: All patients had optic pathway alterations at electrophysiological examination. Significant lower FA were found in OT, IFOF, and CST of KSS group. RD was significantly higher in bilateral OR, IFOF, CST, and right OT, while ADC was higher in bilateral OR and CST. RD values were higher in the proximal and distal portion of OR bilaterally and in the distal portion of right OT, while widespread differences were found in IFOF and CST. No significant differences were found for AD. FA profiles analysis demonstrated significant differences between groups in several regions of OT, IFOF, and CST, while ADC assessment revealed spread differences in OR and CST. Conclusions: DTI evaluation of retrochiasmatic tracks may represent a useful tool to topographically investigate retrochiasmatic visual impairment in KSS.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/337020446_Visual_pathways_evaluation_in_Kearns_Sayre_syndrome_a_diffusion_tensor_imaging_study","name":"Visual pathways evaluation in Kearns Sayre syndrome: a diffusion tensor imaging study","publisher":"Neuroradiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":28,"year":2019},"description":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in clinical applications to highlight brain areas involved in specific cognitive processes. Brain impairments, such as tumors, suppress the fMRI activation of the anatomical areas they invade and, thus, brain-damaged functional networks present missing links\/areas of activation. The identification of the missing circuitry components is of crucial importance to estimate the damage extent. The study of functional networks associated with clinical tasks but performed by healthy individuals becomes, therefore, of paramount concern. These \u201chealthy\u201d networks can, indeed, be used as control networks for clinical studies. In this work we investigate the functional architecture of 20 healthy individuals performing a language task designed for clinical purposes. We unveil a common architecture persistent across all subjects under study, that we call \u201ccore\u201d network, which involves Broca\u2019s area, Wernicke\u2019s area, the premotor area, and the pre-supplementary motor area. We study the connectivity of this circuitry by using the k-core centrality measure, and we find that three of these areas belong to the most robust structure of the functional language network for the specific task under study. Our results provide useful insights on primarily important functional connections.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/337028094_Core_language_brain_network_for_fMRI-language_task_used_in_clinical_applications","name":"Core language brain network for fMRI-language task used in clinical applications","publisher":"Network Neuroscience","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":12,"year":2019},"description":"Purpose Enlargement of deep cerebral veins and choroid plexus engorgement are frequently reported in Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome. We aim to describe cavernous sinus involvement in patients with this syndrome and to identify possible clinical-neuroimaging correlations. Methods Sixty patients with Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome (31 females, mean age 4.5 years) and 120 age\/sex-matched controls were included in this retrospective study. We performed a visual analysis to identify patients with asymmetric cavernous sinus enlargement. Then, we measured on axial T2WI the left (A), right (B), and bilateral (LL) transverse diameters of the cavernous sinus. We calculated the module of the difference |A-B| and the cavernous sinus asymmetry index as the ratio |A-B|\/LL. Differences among groups were assessed by Mann\u2013Whitney U and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests. Clinicoradiological associations were evaluated by Fisher exact test. Results We found seven subjects (11.6%) with asymmetric CS enlargement. The |A-B| and cavernous sinus asymmetry index were higher in patients with asymmetric CS enlargement compared with controls and patients without visible CS abnormalities (pB < 0.05). Asymmetric CS enlargement was always ipsilateral to facial port-wine stains (7\/7), and, when present, to leptomeningeal vascular malformations (4\/7). It was significantly associated with ipsilateral bone marrow changes (p = 0.013) and dilated veins (p = 0.002). Together with brain atrophy and deep venous dilatation, this sign was associated with neurological deficits (p < 0.05). Conclusions We expanded the spectrum of venous abnormalities in SWS, showing the presence of asymmetric cavernous sinus enlargement in more than one tenth of patients, likely related to increased venous drainage.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/331046290_Asymmetric_cavernous_sinus_enlargement_a_novel_finding_in_Sturge-Weber_syndromehttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/331046290_Asymmetric_cavernous_sinus_enlargement_a_novel_finding_in_Sturge-Weber_syndrome","name":"Asymmetric cavernous sinus enlargement: a novel finding in Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome","publisher":"Neuroradiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHnj-kBJScY4Jrs3Q_9eX3Msia1bO9gF_w,NAME_SEARCH,iF3W)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716463860000,"insightId":"0066e7f3-9e58-4dbe-b511-d353715c68b3","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQGVyZt4kG8k0A\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1716463885483?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=1znM93gmndkURup74MnYrNv0CmAKXLYdLJ3pbcDj9GU"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":17},{"type":"PRAISE","count":8}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7199371345330139136","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7199371345330139136","reactionsCount":25,"commentsCount":3,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7199371344705114112","message":{"attributes":[{"start":51,"length":34,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:16213043"}}}],"text":"Metabolic connectivity has a bright future ahead!\n\nAmerican Society of Neuroradiology  2024 meeting - Las Vegas"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7199371344705114112"}}},{"createdAt":1714922460000,"insightId":"26e6e987-0df0-4940-ab53-1cb920b21c3f","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFaLtPvazSMyA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714922440951?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=CI7G_7R8hcf5YLxPbClrRWsrq0exh3xD6VAWvUnsB3o","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFaLtPvazSMyA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714922440951?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=CI7G_7R8hcf5YLxPbClrRWsrq0exh3xD6VAWvUnsB3o"}]},"description":"left hemispheric tumors and 18F-FDG PET\/MRI were retrospectively recruited.
