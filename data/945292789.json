The system is designed as an Internet of Things (IoT) which connects an optofluidic device to a cloud-based server. This system enables researchers across the world to access and control laboratory equipment and scientific experiments  in a secure way. The platform uses polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based optofluidic devices that have a series of pneumatically actuated valves for moving very small volumes of liquid from inlet to the sensing region. The actuation of these valves is controlled by a programmable electronic circuitry based on Raspberry Pi, a small, light, cheap and easy-to-program processor that interconnects our on-site optofluidic device with the cloud-based server through Wi-Fi connection. A web-based user interface (UI) connects a user with the server from any remote location and offers three different modes of operations of the platform. We have demonstrated these features by transferring and executing a script for automatically mixing two different color food grade dyes in our PDMS based optofluidic device. Furthermore, we have utilized this system for automatic optical labeling and detection of E. Coli bacteria biomarker which shows great possibilities of future integration with the organoid system. We are currently designing and implementing an educational module that will allow students from under resourced countries to conduct an E.

Among the three major types of nanopore \u2013biological, solid-state, and hybrid, solid-state nanopores have been demonstrated to be a reliable and robust platform for label and amplification-free detection of biomarkers at single molecule sensitivities.

This feature has also made it significantly easier to integrate solid-state nanopores with other technologies, such as microfluidics, to expand the implementations of nanopores for a wide array of biosensor applications.

Nanopores represent one of the most recent and most promising single molecule sensing paradigms that is seeing increased chip-scale integration for improved convenience and performance. Due to their physical structure, nanopores are highly sensitive, require low sample volume, and offer label-free, amplification-free, high-throughput real-time detection and identification of biomolecules. Over the last 25 years, nanopores have been extensively employed to detect a variety of biomolecules with a growing range of applicatons ranging from nucleic acid sequencing to ultrasensitive diagnostics to single-molecule biophysics. Nanopores, in particular those in solid-state membranes, also have the potential for integration with other technologies such as optics, plasmonics, microfluidics, and optofluidics to perform more complex tasks for an ever-expanding demand. A number of breakthrough results using integrated nanopore platforms have already been reported, and more can be expected as nanopores remain the focus of innovative research and are finding their way into commercial instruments. This review provides an overview of different aspects and challenges of nanopore technology with a focus on chip-scale integration of solid-state nanopores for biosensing and bioanalytical applications.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1039\/D1LC00294E","name":"Recent advances in integrated solid-state nanopore sensors","publisher":"Lab on a chip","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADhYBfUBqg0N-JY__ayHbZxZDLxh3TbHacQ,NAME_SEARCH,yT24)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACCObikBKymWCIEHYq7l1gS0b56mBL-9qOQ,NAME_SEARCH,MazA)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"day":11,"year":2021},"description":"Integrated optofluidic biosensors can fill the need for sensitive, amplification-free, multiplex single molecule detection which is relevant for containing the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

Due to poor vision, often they fail to detect obstacles around them and hurt themselves. Due to aging, abnormal involuntary movements and lack of timely\nrescue system, the magnitude of injury and other adverse effects worsens. One possible way to reduce these old age sufferings could be to design an assistive device which can take corrective measures based on position, neighborhood information and the event of fall (if any). The aim of this research is to develop a cost effective, comfortable and easily producible smart-hat for safe and smooth movement of the elderly people. Some of the key features to be offered by the smart-hat are - obstacle detection, providing aid in the movement in a straight path and fall detection. No such technology exists at present which incorporates all these features in a single device. The proposed device uses very simple methodology. This system takes reading from an accelerometer and differentiates a fall from other normal activities using an adaptive threshold set in triaxial directions. This device aids an elderly person to walk straight using the angular displacement of head movement obtained from a gyroscope. Lastly, few sonar sensors are attached to the hat to sense obstacles around the user covering a 360-degree range. During an event of fall, the system keeps sending request for help to pre-assigned caregivers by using a GSM module. Also, the device makes wireless arrangement for opening the lock of the front door for the ease of rescue operation when the victim is at home. The device showed an overall success rate of nearly 86.25%. The implications of this device would be to reduce number of accidents, decrease the time of arrival of medical attention, increase supervision capability, thus reducing injuries as well as mortality rate; which in turn will ensure independent living of the target group.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1109\/ISTAS.2017.8319088","name":"Smart-hat: Safe and smooth walking assistant for elderly people","publisher":"IEEE","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADhYBfUBqg0N-JY__ayHbZxZDLxh3TbHacQ,NAME_SEARCH,yT24)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABcy95EBiXiz2OXOTdH7dDLGcfji3aR6Vaw,NAME_SEARCH,uTlL)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":13,"year":2020},"description":"We present a method to create robust, nanoscale solid-state membranes using the natural shape of a liquid meniscus as a template.
