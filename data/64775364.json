day\/night cycle. Post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as an important component of circadian networks but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of RNA processing are largely unknown. Here we show that PROTEIN ARGININE METHYL TRANSFERASE 5 (PRMT5), which transfers methyl groups to arginine residues present in histones and Sm spliceosomal proteins links the circadian clock to the control of alternative splicing in plants. Mutations in PRMT5 impair several circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana and this phenotype is caused, at least in part, by a strong alteration in alternative splicing of the core-clock gene PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9). Furthermore, genome-wide studies show that PRMT5 contributes to the regulation of many pre-messenger-RNA splicing events, probably by modulating -splice-site recognition. PRMT5 expression shows daily and circadian oscillations, and this contributes to the mediation of the circadian regulation of expression and alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Circadian rhythms in locomotor activity are also disrupted in dart5-1, a mutant affected in the Drosophila melanogaster PRMT5 homologue, and this is associated with alterations in splicing of the core-clock gene period and several clock-associated genes. Our results demonstrate a key role for PRMT5 in the regulation of alternative splicing and indicate that the interplay between the circadian clock and the regulation of alternative splicing by PRMT5 constitutes a common mechanism that helps organisms to synchronize physiological processes with daily changes in environmental conditions","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v468\/n7320\/full\/nature09470.html","name":"A methyl transferase links the circadian clock to the regulation of alternative splicing.","publisher":"Nature","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPcZMQBnijJI-Bqlf_1L5OmKkW-HgMcfaw,NAME_SEARCH,eRZ4)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"year":2010},"description":"In Arabidopsis, a model genus missing a functional ornithine decarboxylase pathway, most of the key genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis are duplicated. This gene redundancy has been related to the involvement of certain gene isoforms in the response to specific environmental stimuli. We have previously shown that drought stress induces Arginine decarboxlase 2 expression, while transcript levels for Arginine decarboxlase 1 remain constant. Accumulation of putrescine and increased arginine decarboxlase activity (EC 4.1.1.19) levels in response to different abiotic stresses have been reported in many different plant systems, but the biological meaning of this increase remains unclear. To get a new insight into these questions, we have studied the response to drought of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines constitutively expressing the homologous Arginine decarboxlase 2 gene. These lines contain high levels of putrescine with no changes in spermidine and spermine content even under drought stress. Drought tolerance experiments indicate that the different degree of resistance to dehydration correlates with Put content. Although no significant differences were observed in the number of stomata between wild-type and transgenic plants, a reduction in transpiration rate and stomata conductance was observed in the ADC2 over-expressor lines. These results indicate that one of the mechanisms involved in the drought tolerance of transgenic plants over-producing Put is related to a reduction of water loss by transpiration.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S098194281000032X","name":"Putrescine accumulation confers drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over- expressing the homologous Arginine decarboxylase 2 gene.","publisher":"Plant Physiology & Biochemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPcZMQBnijJI-Bqlf_1L5OmKkW-HgMcfaw,NAME_SEARCH,eRZ4)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"year":2011},"description":"Polyamines have been globally associated to plant responses to abiotic stress. Particularly, putrescine has been related to a better response to cold and dehydration stresses. It is known that this polyamine is involved in cold tolerance, since Arabidopsis thaliana plants mutated in the key enzyme responsible for putrescine synthesis (arginine decarboxilase, ADC; EC 4.1.1.19) are more sensitive than the wild type to this stress. Although it is speculated that the overexpression of ADC genes may confer tolerance, this is hampered by pleiotropic effects arising from the constitutive expression of enzymes from the polyamine metabolism. Here, we present our work using A. thaliana transgenic plants harboring the ADC gene from oat under the control of a stress-inducible promoter (pRD29A) instead of a constitutive promoter. The transgenic lines presented in this work were more resistant to both cold and dehydration stresses, associated with a concomitant increment in endogenous putrescine levels under stress. Furthermore, the increment in putrescine upon cold treatment correlates with the induction of known stress-responsive genes, and suggests that putrescine may be directly or indirectly involved in ABA metabolism and gene expression.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3121989\/?tool=pubmed","name":"Putrescine accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines enhances tolerance to dehydration and freezing stress.","publisher":"Plant Signalling & Behaviour","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPcZMQBnijJI-Bqlf_1L5OmKkW-HgMcfaw,NAME_SEARCH,eRZ4)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"year":2009},"description":"Despite our increasing knowledge on the transcriptional networks connecting abscisic acid (ABA) signalling with the circadian clock, the molecular nodes in which both pathways converge to translate the environmental information into a physiological response are not known. Here, we provide evidence of a feedback mechanism linking the circadian clock with plant responses to drought. A key clock component (TOC1, timing of CAB expression 1) binds to the promoter of the ABA-related gene (ABAR\/CHLH\/GUN5) and controls its circadian expression. TOC1 is in turn acutely induced by ABA and this induction advances the phase of TOC1 binding and modulates ABAR circadian expression. Moreover, the gated induction of TOC1 by ABA is abolished in ABAR RNAi plants suggesting that the reciprocal regulation between ABAR and TOC1 expression is important for sensitized ABA activity. Genetic studies with TOC1 and ABAR over-expressing and RNAi plants showed defective responses to drought, which support the notion that clock-dependent gating of ABA function is important for cellular homeostasis under dry environments.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2790485\/?tool=pubmed","name":"TOC1 functions as a molecular switch connecting the circadian clock with plant responses to drought.","publisher":"EMBO Journal","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPcZMQBnijJI-Bqlf_1L5OmKkW-HgMcfaw,NAME_SEARCH,eRZ4)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2008},"description":"The levels of endogenous polyamines have been shown to increase in plant cells challenged with low temperature; however, the functions of polyamines in the regulation of cold stress responses are unknown.

Genes ADC1 and ADC2 show different transcriptional profiles upon cold treatment; however, they show similar and redundant contributions to cold responses in terms of putrescine accumulation kinetics and freezing sensitivity. Our data also demonstrate that detrimental consequences of putrescine depletion during cold stress are due, at least in part, to alterations in the levels of abscisic acid (ABA). Reduced expression of NCED3, a key gene involved in ABA biosynthesis, and down-regulation of ABA-regulated genes are detected in both adc1 and adc2 mutant plants under cold stress. Complementation analysis of adc mutants with ABA and reciprocal complementation tests of the aba2-3 mutant with putrescine support the conclusion that putrescine controls the levels of ABA in response to low temperature by modulating ABA biosynthesis and gene expression","url":"http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/148\/2\/1094.short","name":"Putrescine is involved in Arabidopsis freezing tolerance and cold acclimation by regulating abscisic acid levels in response to low temperature.","publisher":"Plant Phisiology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPcZMQBnijJI-Bqlf_1L5OmKkW-HgMcfaw,NAME_SEARCH,eRZ4)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715204280000,"insightId":"776f1c7a-b10a-4839-a985-7c7e58a696c5","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":13},{"type":"PRAISE","count":1},{"type":"INTEREST","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194088309336252417","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194088309336252417","reactionsCount":17,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194088309336252417","message":{"attributes":[{"length":10,"start":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:alphafold"}}},{"length":24,"start":134,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gc6kr55z"}}}],"text":"Wow!
