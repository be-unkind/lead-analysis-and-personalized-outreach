most influential source of sex education in America today is pornography. For the majority of young people today\u2014including most Christians\u2014attitudes about sex and sexual practices are being shaped wholly, if not exclusively, by pornography. This is nothing new, of course, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly dangerous because porn is becoming increasingly violent.\n\nNumerous studies have confirmed this finding. For example, a 2020 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior looked at a random sampling of videos on the top two most viewed porn sites in the world. The study found physical aggression against women present in 44.3 percent of one site\u2019s videos and 33.9 percent of the other\u2019s. Put simply, between one-third and almost one-half of porn videos depict some sort of violence\u2014and in 97 percent of cases, they depict violence against women.\n\nThis normalization of violence is spilling over into the real world.

That on Shabbat night something happened here on the scale of the splitting of the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cI am a doctor of physics and I worked for several years in the defense industry in Israel, in projects that are still the cutting edge of the State of Israel. When I look at what happened on Saturday night on a scientific level, it simply cannot happen. Everyone, and I mean everyone, acted as one man in overall unity.\n\nHe continued: \"The likelihood that everything works out just as it should does not exist in complex systems like the defense systems that were operating. They have never, I mean never, even beyond the State of Israel, been tried in real time. I took a pencil and dove into the calculations to check the likelihood that such a result would materialize.\n\n\u201cThe large number of events that had to be handled at precisely the right time doubles the chance of making a mistake.\n\n\u201cWith all the high technologies, the expectation was for a breach in the defense of the skies of the State of Israel. Even if we got 90% protection it would be a miracle. What happened though is that everyone, I mean everyone - the pilots, the system operators and the technology operators - acted as one man at one moment in total unity. If this is not an act of God, then I no longer know what a miracle is.\"\n\nAnd the doctor marvels and adds, \"This is sharper than the victory of the Six Day War or the War of Independence. There it can be explained according to nature. The rescue that took place for the people of Israel on Shabbat night is simply impossible naturally. I believe that this miracle saved the lives of many people from Israel. If the defense system had failed to intercept a number of cruise missiles, the result would have dragged us into a very complex campaign.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't bet that next time it will work like this without divine supervision. The simple proof of what I said is that the managers of the security industries who develop and manufacture these systems guarantee no more than 90% success!\n\n\"\u2019Since the day you came out of the land of Egypt we have shown you wonderful things!\u2019 Happy Holidays!\" \n\nThat's how he ended his words."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7186155563536236544"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7188627521339375616"}}},{"createdAt":1716250320000,"insightId":"c5439753-35a0-46dd-9923-271b4000934f","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7198372011826380800,7198475646866497536)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7198372011826380800","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Matthew 6:33"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7198372011826380800"}}},{"createdAt":1715526420000,"insightId":"e7c3ce55-8bf6-4045-ad89-d43497eda5fb","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7195407390463148032,7195439423520456705)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7195407390463148032","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Mom refused to let the Recruiter come unto the front porch...
