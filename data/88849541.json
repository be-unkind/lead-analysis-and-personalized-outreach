Pharma\u2019s Almanac's to discuss the topic of additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, and how it is reshaping pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nUnlike traditional oral solid dose (OSD) manufacturing, 3D printing offers unparalleled flexibility in designing drug prototypes, final dosage forms enabling precision dosing and the creation of complex release kinetics. This technology is especially valuable during early R&D, for creating innovative dosage forms and streamlining the supply of clinical trial material. Our raw materials portfolio plays a leading role in the 3D printing space, establishing collaborations and developing products to realize the potential of additive manufacturing. #solidformulation #formulation #osd #drugdevelopment"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7175884727801774080"}}},{"createdAt":1710432240000,"insightId":"819ebec8-aa74-44bc-a19b-c7b6c656f2d9","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E10AQEwZZDI3J16jA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1710432241359?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=S4Q0lgiSwSSMWOyfA8CodECfXCj8CSi4PJXw_nzqERs","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E10AQEwZZDI3J16jA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1710432241359?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=S4Q0lgiSwSSMWOyfA8CodECfXCj8CSi4PJXw_nzqERs"}]},"resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Vdvl5C","title":"Enhancing API Solubility During API Processing and Formulation Development MilliporeSigma"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":12}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7174072796291989504","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7174072796291989504","reactionsCount":12,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7174072793968300034","message":{"attributes":[{"start":744,"length":22,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:solubilityenhancement"}}},{"start":767,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:formulation"}}},{"start":780,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:drugdevelopment"}}}],"text":"Understanding the impact of API solubility on the performance of a given drug product and determining ways to enhance dissolution rates is critical to ensuring your product makes it to market, into the hands of patients and clinicians, is well absorbed and provides its intended therapeutic effect.
