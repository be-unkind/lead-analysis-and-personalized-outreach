Its Center for Observational Research (CfOR) is well-known for its pioneering position in using high-quality real-world evidence to shape drug development and bring innovative therapies more quickly to patients in need. I'm glad that I will be able to leverage both my real-world data analytics expertise gained from my PhD training at Stanford and the strategic thinking and adaptability from McKinsey in this new position. I am eager to utilize real-world patient data to address questions across the drug development lifecycle and to advance the understanding of disease, therapeutic interventions, and clinical outcomes.\n\nI am really grateful for my time at McKinsey. It would be a perfect job choice for any fresh graduate\u2014you'll have exposure to a wide range of industries, build up a structured way of problem-solving, and have opportunities to interact with senior executives and influence C-suite decisions early in your career\u2014not to mention the perks of hotel points and airline mileage from frequent travel (Traveling with my Marriott ambassador status in Asia was truly amazing).\n\nOver the past year and a half, I've worked across the spectrum of the healthcare industry, serving clients in public health departments, medical device companies, pharmaceuticals, and biotech companies. I've experienced long but rewarding hours doing due diligence and developing acquisition strategies for a leading MedTech company and also enjoyed a project with the best work-life balance, doing commercial analytics for a transformation study. Leveraging my R and SAS coding expertise was fantastic.\n\nI am fortunate to have always worked with caring leaders at the firm. As a mom of a toddler and a wife to a husband who is training for medical residency and fellowship, I can never say that I am able to balance family and work. However, all my EMs have given me a lot of space and respect when I needed to take a break to care for my daughter. I co-led the SCA mom group in our Southern California office and understand how difficult it is for moms to navigate a consulting career, but we are fortunate enough to have many supportive leaders at McKinsey.\n\nDuring my last few months at the firm, I was able to take some time off to focus on my passion project about Chinese movies. I volunteered to interview one of the most acclaimed Hong Kong movie directors, spending over 16 hours discussing her movies and stories. The interview was conducted in English, and I'm excited about the publication of the book over the next year."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7197321263143428096"}}},{"createdAt":1716458160000,"insightId":"433f8320-db96-4c15-acbf-d5c7660103cd","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7199347339566698496)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Yee Hang\ud83e\udd70"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1716095940000,"insightId":"28d163aa-b89c-441a-b021-07837d5658af","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197828181221924864)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Kayla\ud83e\udd70"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1716040620000,"insightId":"74c4b88d-a561-41af-92dd-33a53afc9f30","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197596261674328065)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1716040620000,"insightId":"75f50d19-234d-436e-9cf6-921948c53057","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197596193365897216)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Michelle\ud83e\udd70"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1715999640000,"insightId":"b15d9866-2b6a-429e-b01b-8c9e760d518e","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197424155200282624)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1715999640000,"insightId":"2cd433ce-9520-4ea4-9f3a-bf78173ef723","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197424206546968576)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761"}}},{"createdAt":1715988480000,"insightId":"7bb3b242-6e4f-40ae-85e3-e6e160eff5ca","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197328876362997761,7197377526371946496)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197328876362997761","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you Sidd!
