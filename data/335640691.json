One such technology utilizes microneedle (MN) patches and it has made considerable clinical advances in systemic delivery of potent macromolecules and vaccines. The objective of this study was to develop a drug product using the MN technology that has similar bioperformance when compared to subcutaneous route of delivery and can provide improved stability under storage. Therapeutic Peptide A is being developed as a subcutaneous injection for chronic dosing with a submilligram estimated therapeutic dose. Peptide A has chemical and physical stability challenges in solution and this led to exploration of a viable drug product which could provide therapeutic dosages while overcoming the stability issues seen with the compound. This work focused on developing a coated solid microstructure transdermal system (sMTS) for Peptide A followed by detailed in vitro and preclinical evaluation for two different coating formulations. Based on initial assessment, ~250 \u03bcg of Peptide A could be coated with precision on a 1.27cm2 patch which contained 316 MN\u2019s. The delivery from these systems was achieved with absolute bioavailability being similar to the subcutaneous delivery (88% and 74% for coated sMTS 1 & 2 and 75% for subcutaneous delivery). Stability of Peptide A was also found to be significantly improved when coated on the sMTS system with minimal degradation recorded at room temperature storage as compared to the subcutaneous liquid formulation. Additionally, skin irritation (on pig skin) was also measured in this study and it was found to be minimal and self-resolving. This evaluation provided a viable option for developing a drug product with improved stability and successful delivery of the investigated molecule.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10544-019-0462-1","name":"Coated Microneedles for Transdermal Delivery of a Potent Pharmaceutical Peptide","publisher":"Biomedical Microdevices","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":16,"year":2019},"description":"Peptides and proteins commonly have complex structural landscapes allowing for transformation into a wide array of species including oligomers, aggregates, and fibrils.

Mutations in ATP7B cause the potentially fatal hepatoneurological disorder Wilson disease. The activity and intracellular localization of ATP7B are regulated by copper, but the molecular mechanism of this regulation is largely unknown. We show that the copper chaperone Atox1, which delivers copper to ATP7B, and the group of the first three metal-binding domains (MBD1\u20133) are central to the activity regulation of ATP7B. Atox1\u2013Cu binding to ATP7B changes domain dynamics and interactions within the MBD1\u20133 group and activates ATP hydrolysis. To understand the mechanism linking Atox1\u2013MBD interactions and enzyme activity, we have determined the MBD1\u20133 conformational space using small angle X-ray scattering and identified changes in MBD dynamics caused by apo\u2013Atox1 and Atox1\u2013Cu by solution NMR. The results show that copper transfer from Atox1 decreases domain interactions within the MBD1\u20133 group and increases the mobility of the individual domains. The N-terminal segment of MBD1\u20133 was found to interact with the nucleotide-binding domain of ATP7B, thus physically coupling the domains involved in copper binding and those involved in ATP hydrolysis. Taken together, the data suggest a regulatory mechanism in which Atox1-mediated copper transfer activates ATP7B by releasing inhibitory constraints through increased freedom of MBD1\u20133 motions.","url":"https:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/292\/44\/18169.long","name":"The Metal Chaperone Atox1 Regulates the Activity of the Human Copper Transporter ATP7B by Modulating Domain Dynamics","publisher":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":8,"year":2016},"description":"The kinetics of folding and unfolding underlie protein stability and quantification of these rates provides important insights into the folding process.

The same is true when trying to develop oral formulations for preclinical species, especially unconventional formulations, such as sustained release tablets. During the evaluation of such specialized dosage forms, dissolution can be a critical in vitro tool used to rank-order formulations and ultimately choose the desired release rate. Here, the development of a canine biorelevant dissolution method for the prediction of the in vivo performance of sustained release matrix tablets in beagle dogs is described. The method accounts for differences in physiology between humans and dogs such as gastrointestinal fluid composition, gastric emptying forces, and gastric residence time. The most critical dissolution method parameters were found to be the paddle speed used to simulate the gastric emptying forces as well as the time spent in simulated gastric fluid. The resulting differences in method conditions are further explored through in silico models of the hydrodynamic forces applied to a dosage form. Two case studies are reported showing that the method was able to obtain excellent in vitro-in vivo relationships (slopes ranging from 1.08-1.01) which are significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.01-0.05) improved compared to human biorelevant dissolution used to predict in vivo performance in humans (slopes \u223c1.5-1.75).

Both states appear to be functionally important because proteins involved in the assembly or transfer of Fe-S clusters have been shown to interact preferentially with either the S or D state of IscU.

Here, we use simulations to examine the uncertainty with which exchange parameters can be determined for two state systems in intermediate-to-fast exchange using off-resonance R1\u03c1 relaxation dispersion. R1\u03c1 data computed by solving the Bloch-McConnell equations reveals small but significant asymmetry with respect to offset (R1\u03c1 (\u0394\u03a9)\u2260R1\u03c1 (-\u0394\u03a9)), which is a hallmark of slow-to-intermediate exchange, even under conditions of fast exchange for free precession chemical exchange line broadening (k(ex)\/\u0394\u03c9>10).

Whereas extensive studies of most ISC proteins have revealed their functional properties, the role of IscX (also dubbed YfhJ), a small acidic protein encoded by the last gene in the operon, has remained in question. Previous studies showed that IscX binds iron ions and interacts with the cysteine desulfurase (IscS) and the scaffold protein for cluster assembly (IscU), and it has been proposed that IscX functions either as an iron supplier or a regulator of Fe-S cluster biogenesis. We have used a combination of NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), chemical cross-linking, and enzymatic assays to enlarge our understanding of the interactions of IscX with iron ions, IscU, and IscS. We used chemical shift perturbation to identify the binding interfaces of IscX and IscU in their complex. NMR studies showed that Fe(2+) from added ferrous ammonium sulfate binds IscX much more avidly than does Fe(3+) from added ferric ammonium citrate and that Fe(2+) strengthens the interaction between IscX and IscU. We found that the addition of IscX to the IscU-IscS binary complex led to the formation of a ternary complex with reduced cysteine desulfurase activity, and we determined a low-resolution model for that complex from a combination of NMR and SAXS data. We postulate that the inhibition of cysteine desulfurase activity by IscX serves to reduce unproductive conversion of cysteine to alanine. By incorporating these new findings with results from prior studies, we propose a detailed mechanism for Fe-S cluster assembly in which IscX serves both as a donor of Fe(2+) and as a regulator of cysteine desulfurase activity.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/ja501260h","name":"Role of IscX in Iron-Sulfur Cluster Biogenesis in Escherichia Coli","publisher":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":16,"year":2013},"description":"IscU from Escherichia coli, the scaffold protein for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and delivery, populates a complex energy landscape.

In vivo, Z-DNA is generated in the presence of negative supercoiling or upon binding proteins that absorb the high energetic cost of the B-to-Z transition, including the creation of distorted junctions between B-DNA and Z-DNA. To date, the sequence preferences for the B-to-Z transition have primarily been studied in the context of sequence repeats lacking B-Z junctions. Here, we develop a method for characterizing sequence-specific preferences for Z-DNA formation and B-Z junction localization within heterogeneous DNA duplexes that is based on combining 2-aminopurine fluorescence measurements with a new quantitative application of circular dichroism spectroscopy for determining the fraction of B- versus Z-DNA. Using this approach, we show that at least three consecutive CC dinucleotide steps, traditionally thought to disfavor Z-DNA, can be incorporated within heterogeneous Z-DNA containing B-Z junctions upon binding to the Z\u03b1 domain of the RNA adenosine deaminase protein. Our results indicate that the incorporation of CC steps into Z-DNA is driven by favorable sequence-specific Z-Z and B-Z stacking interactions as well as by sequence-specific energetics that localize the distorted B-Z junction at flexible sites. Together, our results expose higher-order complexities in the Z-DNA code within heterogeneous sequences and suggest that Z-DNA can in principle propagate into a wider range of genomic sequence elements than previously thought.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/bi300785b","name":"Incorporation of CC steps into Z-DNA: Interplay Between B-Z Junction and Z-DNA Helical Formation","publisher":"Biochemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":28,"year":2011},"description":"Many recently discovered noncoding RNAs do not fold into a single native conformation but sample many different conformations along their free-energy landscape to carry out their biological function.

We have used our observations and solubility data to construct a complete phase diagram for this system. Utilizing phase diagram theory and the Gibbs phase rule, we conclude that this system is not a true binary system but rather a pseudobinary system, which has a range of concentrations that cannot be represented by a simple binary phase diagram and thus must be viewed as part of the ternary system: H(2)SO(4)\/(NH(4))(2)SO(4)\/H(2)O.

Of particular importance is the definition of a drug product formulation that meets requirements as defined by the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and mitigates peptide-specific Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) liabilities. Peptide drug product formulations can range widely in complexity, but often require the inclusion of excipients that are selected to perform a number of functions, such as buffering pH, preserving sterility, mitigating chemical and\/or physical instabilities of the peptide active substance or controlling the rate of peptide drug release upon administration in people. The choice of excipient(s) and composition(s) can impact multiple drug product attributes, which necessitates appropriate formulation characterization and data-driven decision-making regarding excipient use throughout development and ultimately in the final drug product. This chapter briefly surveys categories of excipients employed in therapeutic peptide formulation development, highlights guidance and regulations related to the selection and evaluation of such excipients and discusses the assessment and justification of excipient use in formulations, from discovery through development, with a focus on peptide-specific challenges in parenteral formulations.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/chapter\/bk9781788014335-00472\/978-1-78801-433-5","name":"Assessing the Impact of Functional Excipients on Peptide Drug Product Attributes During Pharmaceutical Development","publisher":"Peptide Therapeutics: Strategy and Tactics for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls - Chapter 13","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":10,"year":2021},"description":"Herein is described the development of a large-scale manufacturing process for molnupiravir, an orally dosed antiviral that was recently demonstrated to be efficacious for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Early in the pandemic, Merck & Co. Inc. partnered with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to accelerate the development of a manufacturing process for the drug in anticipation of high global demand for the treatment. It was essential to quickly establish a robust manufacturing process, as well as a rigorous physical attribute control strategy, to enable rapid delivery of metric tons of molnupiravir. Given the drug load of >50% (w\/w) API in the formulation, there was high potential for the physical attributes to have a strong effect on drug product performance. Molnupiravir can also exist as multiple polymorphs and has the potential for wide variations in particle size. To address these challenges, we performed extensive derisking of these attributes with respect to the impact on drug product performance and were ultimately able to demonstrate the acceptability of a wide range of API physical attributes. In parallel, we strategically designed a scalable crystallization process that consistently delivered drug substance within our derisked range of attributes, across multiple manufacturing sites and scales. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that the API\u2019s physical attributes did not affect the drug product\u2019s critical quality attributes or therapeutic efficacy, giving our multiple manufacturing sites greater flexibility to deliver metric tons of molnupiravir to patients in need.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.oprd.3c00268","name":"Polymorphs, Particle Size, and a Pandemic: Development of a Scalable Crystallization Process for Molnupiravir, an Antiviral for the Treatment of COVID-19","publisher":"Organic Process Research & Development","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQBeHMBPV1Covuo0X_jRsvc0nc8w6Tt4ek,NAME_SEARCH,Fh6Z)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716214140000,"insightId":"d63f8d6e-72d9-47a2-b33f-378a986c1211","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":33},{"type":"PRAISE","count":4},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7198324064732491777","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7198324064732491777","reactionsCount":39,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7198324063943962625","message":{"attributes":[{"start":438,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:995493020"}}},{"start":459,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:300394021"}}},{"start":499,"length":39,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:203186139"}}},{"start":549,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:174921815"}}},{"start":765,"length":17,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:medicationsafety"}}},{"start":783,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:healthcare"}}},{"start":795,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:patientsafety"}}},{"start":810,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:primarycare"}}},{"start":823,"length":15,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:outpatientcare"}}},{"start":839,"length":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:pharmacy"}}}],"text":"I was honored to participate for the second time in the \"Optimizing Medication Safety in Primary Care & Outpatient Settings\" webinar series organized by CPD Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.
