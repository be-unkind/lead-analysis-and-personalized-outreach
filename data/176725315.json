Here, using a loss-of-function CRISPR screen, we identify DYNLL1 as an inhibitor of DNA end resection. The loss of DYNLL1 enables DNA end resection and restores homologous recombination in BRCA1-mutant cells, thereby inducing resistance to platinum drugs and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Low BRCA1 expression correlates with increased chromosomal aberrations in primary ovarian carcinomas, and the junction sequences of somatic structural variants indicate diminished homologous recombination. Concurrent decreases in DYNLL1 expression in carcinomas with low BRCA1 expression reduced genomic alterations and increased homology at lesions. In cells, DYNLL1 limits nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends by associating with the DNA end-resection machinery (MRN complex, BLM helicase and DNA2 endonuclease). In vitro, DYNLL1 binds directly to MRE11 to limit its end-resection activity. Therefore, we infer that DYNLL1 is an important anti-resection factor that influences genomic stability and responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30464262","name":"DYNLL1 binds to MRE11 to limit DNA end resection in BRCA1-deficient cells.","publisher":"Nature","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAqInUMBkPNbxWtB_jQ2MUcHPsMDDtdPrfE,NAME_SEARCH,nb9L)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":11,"year":2018},"description":"Nitroxides occupy a privileged position among plausible metal-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) due to their inherently low-toxicity profiles; nevertheless, their translational development has been hindered by a lack of appropriate contrast sensitivity. Nanostructured materials with high nitroxide densities, where each individual nitroxide within a macromolecular construct contributes to the image contrast, could address this limitation, but the synthesis of such materials remains challenging. Here, we report a modular and scalable synthetic approach to nitroxide-based brush-arm star polymer (BASP) organic radical CAs (ORCAs) with high nitroxide loadings. The optimized \u223c30 nm diameter \"BASP-ORCA3\" displays outstanding T2 sensitivity with a very high molecular transverse relaxivity ( r2 > 1000 mM-1 s-1). BASP-ORCA3 further exhibits excellent stability in vivo, no acute toxicity, and highly desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles for longitudinal detection of tumors by MRI. When injected intravenously into mice bearing subcutaneous plasmacytomas, BASP-ORCA3 affords distinct in vivo visualization of tumors on translationally relevant time scales. Leveraging its high sensitivity, BASP-ORCA3 enables efficient mapping of tumor necrosis, which is an important biomarker to predict therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, BASP-ORCA3 allows for detection of millimetric tumor implants in a disseminated murine model of advanced-stage human ovarian cancer that possess genetic, histological, and vascular characteristics that are similar to those seen in patients.

In this study, the authors examine the potential increase in tumor blood vessel endothelial cell radiation dose enhancement with the low Z target.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe authors use Monte Carlo methods to simulate delivery of three different clinical photon beams: (1) a 6 MV standard (Cu\/W) beam, (2) a 6 MV flattening filter free (Cu\/W), and (3) a 6 MV (carbon) beam. The photon energy spectra for each scenario are generated for depths in tissue-equivalent material: 2, 10, and 20 cm. The endothelial dose enhancement for each target and depth is calculated using a previously published analytic method.\n\nRESULTS:\nIt is found that the carbon target increases the proportion of low energy (<150 keV) photons at 10 cm depth to 28% from 8% for the 6 MV standard (Cu\/W) beam. This nearly quadrupling of the low energy photon content incident on a gold nanoparticle results in 7.7 times the endothelial dose enhancement as a 6 MV standard (Cu\/W) beam at this depth.

The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate (PK) equivalence of HD201, EU-Herceptin\u00ae , and US-Herceptin\u00ae given at 6 mg\/kg as a 90-min i.v. infusion to healthy male subjects. A pairwise comparisons based on the primary endpoint AUC0-inf and secondary PK endpoints, AUC0-last and Cmax were undertaken. PK equivalence was to be concluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric means for each criterion were within the equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. Secondary objectives included assessment of other PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in the three arms. A total of 105 healthy male subjects (35\/treatment) were randomized in this study. The 90% CI for the ratios of AUC0-inf , Cmax and AUC0-last , were within 80%-125% for the comparisons of HD201 to EU-Herceptin\u00ae or US-Herceptin\u00ae and EU-Herceptin\u00ae to US-Herceptin\u00ae . The frequency of subjects with TEAEs of special interest was slightly lower in the HD201 group (20.0%) compared to the other treatment groups (EU-Herceptin\u00ae : 34.3%; US-Herceptin\u00ae : 31.4%). Only 1 subject (EU-Herceptin\u00ae group) developed anti-drug antibodies prior to dosing. Overall, HD201 demonstrates PK similarity to both EU-Herceptin\u00ae and US-Herceptin\u00ae . The three study drugs also demonstrated similar safety profiles.","publisher":"Pharmacol Res Perspect","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAqInUMBkPNbxWtB_jQ2MUcHPsMDDtdPrfE,NAME_SEARCH,nb9L)"}]},{"name":"Anti-BCMA Immuno-NanoPET Radiotracers for Improved Detection of Multiple Myeloma","publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":28,"year":2021},"description":"Current clinical imaging modalities for the sensitive and specific detection of multiple myeloma (MM) rely on nonspecific imaging contrast agents based on gadolinium chelates for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or for 18 F-FDG-directed and combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans. These tracers are not, however, able to detect minute plasma cell populations in the tumor niche, leading to false negative results. Here, a novel PET-based anti-BCMA nanoplatform labeled with 64 Cu is developed to improve the monitoring of these cells in both the spine and femur and to compare its sensitivity and specificity to more conventional immunoPET (64 Cu labeled anti-BCMA antibody) and passively targeted PET radiotracers (64 CuCl2 and 18 F-FDG). This proof-of-concept preclinical study confirmed that by conjugating up to four times more radioisotopes per antibody with the immuno-nanoPET platform, an improvement in the sensitivity and in the specificity of PET to detect tumor cells in an orthotopic model of MM is observed when compared to the traditional immunoPET approach. It is anticipated that when combined with tumor biopsy, this immuno-nanoPET platform may improve the management of patients with MM.","publisher":"Adv Healthcare Mat","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAqInUMBkPNbxWtB_jQ2MUcHPsMDDtdPrfE,NAME_SEARCH,nb9L)"}]},{"name":"Optimal physicochemical properties of antibody-nanoparticle conjugates for improved tumor targeting","publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":1,"year":2022},"description":"Tumor-targeted antibody (mAb)\/fragment-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. However, the physicochemical properties of full mAb-NPs and fragment-NPs-that is, NP material, size, charge, as well as the targeting antibody moiety, and the linker conjugation strategies-remain to be optimized to achieve an efficient tumor targeting. A meta-analysis of 161 peer-reviewed studies is presented, which describes the use of tumor-targeted mAb-NPs and fragment-NPs from 2009 to 2021. The use of these targeted NPs is confirmed to result in significantly greater tumor uptake of NPs than that of naked NPs (7.9 \u00b1 1.9% ID g-1 versus 3.2 \u00b1 0.6% ID g-1 , respectively). The study further demonstrates that for lipidic NPs, fragment-NPs provide a significantly higher tumor uptake than full mAb-NPs. In parallel, for both polymeric and organic\/inorganic NPs, full mAb-NPs yield a significant higher tumor uptake than fragment-NPs. In addition, for both lipidic and polymeric NPs, the tumor uptake is improved with the smallest sizes of the conjugates. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of the conjugates are demonstrated to be driven by the NPs and not by the antibody moieties, independently of using full mAb-NPs or fragment-NPs, confirming the importance of optimizing the NP design to improve the tumor uptake.","publisher":"Advanced Materials","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAqInUMBkPNbxWtB_jQ2MUcHPsMDDtdPrfE,NAME_SEARCH,nb9L)"}]},{"name":"A Combination of Native LC-MS Approaches for the Comprehensive Characterization of the Antibody-Drug Conjugate Trastuzumab Deruxtecan","publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":1,"year":2022},"description":"Native mass spectrometry (nMS) approaches appear attractive to complement bottom-up strategies traditionally used in biopharmaceutical industries thanks to their quite straightforward and rapid workflows, especially through online hyphenation of non-denaturing liquid chromatography (LC) to nMS.

Here we report a bottlebrush prodrug (BPD) platform designed to answer these questions in the context of multiple myeloma therapy. We show that proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib)-based BPD monotherapy slows tumour progression in vivo and that mixtures of bortezomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone BPDs exhibit in vitro synergistic, additive or antagonistic patterns distinct from their corresponding free-drug counterparts. BPDs carrying a statistical mixture of three drugs in a synergistic ratio outperform the free-drug combination at the same ratio as well as a mixture of single-drug BPDs in the same ratio.

Using a series of small molecule antagonists, we demonstrate a conformational equilibrium between an open and a pre-existing lowly populated closed state of 53BP1 in which the H4K20me2 binding surface is buried at the interface between two interacting 53BP1 molecules. In cells, these antagonists inhibit the chromatin recruitment of wild type 53BP1, but do not affect 53BP1 variants unable to access the closed conformation despite preservation of the H4K20me2 binding site. Thus, this inhibition operates by shifting the conformational equilibrium toward the closed state. Our work therefore identifies an auto-associated form of 53BP1-autoinhibited for chromatin binding-that can be stabilized by small molecule ligands encapsulated between two 53BP1 protomers. Such ligands are valuable research tools to study the function of 53BP1 and have the potential to facilitate the development of new drugs for cancer therapy.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37773238\/","name":"An autoinhibited state of 53BP1 revealed by small molecule antagonists and protein engineering","publisher":"Nat Commun","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAqInUMBkPNbxWtB_jQ2MUcHPsMDDtdPrfE,NAME_SEARCH,nb9L)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1713184500000,"insightId":"d638a79d-c0d6-4467-8362-afd057b98251","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":73},{"type":"PRAISE","count":9},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7185616823160119297","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7185616823160119297","reactionsCount":83,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7185616822677741571","message":{"attributes":[{"start":6,"length":36,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:89366893"}}},{"start":68,"length":20,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:89252207"}}},{"start":92,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:vaincrelecancer"}}},{"start":109,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:amAezliorerlaqualitAezdevie"}}}],"text":"Merci Le Journal des Entreprises Grand Est pour cette interview sur Recobia Therapeutics \ud83e\udd17 #vaincrelecancer #am\u00e9liorerlaqualit\u00e9devie"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQEJF8ZFaeQ9_A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1713183972844?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=H2l1pi7NqiwS5PsU8f-Gqo2219yJ64IpUtqWF8bq2bI","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQEJF8ZFaeQ9_A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1713183972844?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=H2l1pi7NqiwS5PsU8f-Gqo2219yJ64IpUtqWF8bq2bI"}]},"description":"Spin-off de l\u2019Institut de canc\u00e9rologie Strasbourg Europe (ICANS), la start-up Recobia Therapeutics d\u00e9veloppe une solution d\u2019administration sous-cutan\u00e9e des bioth\u00e9rapies, dans le but d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le\u2026","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.lejournaldesentreprises.com\/article\/recobia-therapeutics-veut-ameliorer-le-confort-des-patients-atteints-de-cancer-2093873","title":"Recobia Therapeutics veut am\u00e9liorer le confort des patients atteints de cancer"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7185615555029049344","message":{"attributes":[{"start":46,"length":17,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:176725315"}}},{"start":223,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eZbm_6un"}}}],"text":"Business media talk about us !\u00a0\ud83c\udf1f \n\nCheck out Alexandre Detappe's interview in Le Journal des Entreprises where he is elaborating on our vision to facilitate access to cutting edge cancer therapies to everyone everywhere.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/eZbm_6un\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7185615555029049344"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7185616822677741571"}}},{"createdAt":1711616940000,"insightId":"611b39b4-7bb4-4615-b991-7ec4f34bbea0","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":18},{"type":"PRAISE","count":5}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7179041893966581760","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7179041893966581760","reactionsCount":23,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7179041893966581760","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"What an achievement!
