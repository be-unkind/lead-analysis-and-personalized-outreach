To address this, we developed a serum-stable, nanoparticle catalyst-labeled LFIA with a sensitivity surpassing that of both current commercial and published sensitivities for paper-based detection of p24, one of the earliest and most conserved biomarkers of HIV. We report the synthesis and characterization of porous platinum core\u2013shell nanocatalysts (PtNCs), which show high catalytic activity when exposed to complex human blood serum samples. We explored the application of antibody-functionalized PtNCs with strategically and orthogonally modified nanobodies with high affinity and specificity toward p24 and established the key larger nanoparticle size regimes needed for efficient amplification and performance in LFIA. Harnessing the catalytic amplification of PtNCs enabled naked-eye detection of p24 spiked into sera in the low femtomolar range (ca. 0.8 pg\u00b7mL\u20131) and the detection of acute-phase HIV in clinical human plasma samples in under 20 min. This provides a versatile absorbance-based and rapid LFIA with sensitivity capable of significantly reducing the HIV acute phase detection window. This diagnostic may be readily adapted for detection of other biomolecules as an ultrasensitive screening tool for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and can be capitalized upon in PoC settings for early disease detection.","publisher":"ACS Nano","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acsnano.7b06229","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYnIEQB8hTWQjmkF4i1JAYtFTLzbsGH0hM,NAME_SEARCH,Oc66)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASwgvgB07fsPBfKM1RwcwPyvUin1SICqSs,NAME_SEARCH,9zan)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA22dq0BScEhobUBhGMxS72DMWsqWbaYO1I,NAME_SEARCH,Tj43)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABt2RFIBKE74XyrxEdzGeNVv9wpLrG0GHtU,NAME_SEARCH,go6H)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABAlo30Bsa_iHRo2UV4FhifJFsCzzBVTa6o,NAME_SEARCH,UWRa)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":29,"year":2018},"description":"Due to their exquisite cysteine-selectivity, excellent stability, and ability to functionally rebridge disulfide bonds, dibromopyridazinediones are emerging as an exciting new class of bioconjugation reagents, particularly in the field of antibody conjugation.

The initial work expands on a previously reported thiomaleimide [2+2] photocycloaddition to develop a method for photochemically rebridging peptides and proteins at the site of a disulfide bond. This method was employed for the photochemical activation of the therapeutic peptide Octreotide, and as a tool for generating highly thiol stable bis-modified antibody fragment conjugates. During the course of this study two novel thiomaleimide-mediated photochemical decarboxylation reactions were discovered and their utility as photolabile linkers for bioconjugation was explored. This led to the development of a cysteine selective photolabile linker based around the thiomaleimide scaffold, which was subsequently employed to release an analogue of the cytotoxic drug Doxorubicin from an anti-CEA scFv antibody fragment. This work highlights the previously unreported ability of thiomaleimides to act as electron acceptors in photoinduced electron transfer reactions, greatly expanding the reactivity profile of this chemical motif. The excellent photochemical reactivity of thiomaleimides, coupled with the relative ease of their installation on proteins, suggests that these reagents could play an important part in the future of photochemical protein and peptide manipulation.","url":"http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1485799\/","name":"The Development of Novel Thiomaleimide Photochemical Transformations and Their Application to the Manipulation of Proteins","publisher":"University College London","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYnIEQB8hTWQjmkF4i1JAYtFTLzbsGH0hM,NAME_SEARCH,Oc66)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714120200000,"insightId":"5bfa8ae6-2846-4968-b90f-624e3ae8d4ed","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQHBUTvXliEc9A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714120183199?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=KvZGZPyZf-xA-w9dT5IHALf1evS28baeMTW-mhuV508","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQHBUTvXliEc9A\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714120183199?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=KvZGZPyZf-xA-w9dT5IHALf1evS28baeMTW-mhuV508"}]},"description":"Paper-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an essential component of modern healthcare, particularly for the management of infectious diseases.

Despite their utility, these capillary-driven RDTs are compromised by high failure rates, primarily caused by user error. This limits their utility in complex assays that require multiple user operations. Here, we demonstrate how this issue can be directly addressed through continuous electrochemical monitoring of reagent flow inside an RDT using embedded graphenized electrodes. Our method relies on applying short voltage pulses and measuring variations in capacitive discharge currents to precisely determine the flow times of injected samples and reagents. This information is reported to the user, guiding them through the testing process, highlighting failure cases and ultimately decreasing errors. Significantly, the same electrodes can be used to quantify electrochemical signals from immunoassays, providing an integrated solution for both monitoring assays and reporting results. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a serology test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in clinical serum samples.

Jake Lesinski has put together another paper (preprint) in which we report a simple way to improve the limit-of-detection in an RPA\u2013CRISPR-Cas12a assay for HPV-16. Jake's short manuscript describes how we can exploit the association kinetics between sgRNA and Cas proteins to modulate cis-exonuclease activity and improve the sensitivity of these assays. Crucially, this method requires no additional equipment, bespoke reagents, or complicated protocols - in fact, it is simpler than existing methods. Anyone working on NAAT\u2013CRISPR-Cas assays or biosensors could (and should!) immediately incorporate this method into their work. Special thanks to Thomas Moragues and L\u00e9onard Bezinge for their help in putting together a mechanistic model to explain our results and provide some insight into the workings of these promising assays. Further thanks to Prerit Mathur, Carolina Paganini, and Yang Shen for their support. It's been my pleasure to work with these unbeleivably talented researchers as they've put together this nice piece of work.\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/dK7a-FbN"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7181986257994932224"}}}]}
