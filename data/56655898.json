Modeling strategies in support of QbD paradigm for biologics are particularly important because of the costs involved in the development of biologic products (Group CBW 2009; Fissore and Antonello (Qual Des Biopharm Drug Prod Dev 18:565\u201393, 2015)). This mini-review focuses on the application of mechanistic models in the development of biologic drug products as ready-to-use solutions or lyophilized drug products. The choice of the modeling approach is dependent on the specific processes involved in the unit operation as well as intent of application of modeling. The application of models to unit operations in biologics drug product processing such as mixing (compounding), membrane transfer (ultrafiltration\/diafiltration), freeze-thaw, and lyophilization, to characterize the quality risks, define the design space, provide input to control strategy, and build robustness in the process will be discussed.","url":"http:\/\/rd.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12247-016-9250-0?view=classic","name":"Application of Mechanistic Models for Process Design and Development of Biologic Drug Products","publisher":"Journal of Pharmaceutical Innovation","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANggBoB0y9pTiNRq_qeNuDONgta7dfOssE,NAME_SEARCH,-Hqx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADFhYMBpAbKHAZpwH8z5OJBydzBjQVLWRI,NAME_SEARCH,8gdr)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"year":2015},"description":"Lyophilization is an approach commonly undertaken to formulate drugs that are unstable to be commercialized as ready to use (RTU) solutions. One of the important aspects of commercializing a lyophilized product is to transfer the process parameters that are developed in lab scale lyophilizer to commercial scale without a loss in product quality. This process is often accomplished by costly engineering runs or through an iterative process at the commercial scale. Here, we are highlighting a combination of computational and experimental approach to predict commercial process parameters for the primary drying phase of lyophilization. Heat and mass transfer coefficients are determined experimentally either by manometric temperature measurement (MTM) or sublimation tests and used as inputs for the finite element model (FEM)-based software called PASSAGE, which computes various primary drying parameters such as primary drying time and product temperature. The heat and mass transfer coefficients will vary at different lyophilization scales; hence, we present an approach to use appropriate factors while scaling-up from lab scale to commercial scale. As a result, one can predict commercial scale primary drying time based on these parameters. Additionally, the model-based approach presented in this study provides a process to monitor pharmaceutical product robustness and accidental process deviations during Lyophilization to support commercial supply chain continuity. The approach presented here provides a robust lyophilization scale-up strategy; and because of the simple and minimalistic approach, it will also be less capital intensive path with minimal use of expensive drug substance\/active material.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25791415","name":"Finite Element Method (FEM) Modeling of Freeze-drying: Monitoring Pharmaceutical Product Robustness During Lyophilization","publisher":"AAPS PharmSciTech","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANggBoB0y9pTiNRq_qeNuDONgta7dfOssE,NAME_SEARCH,-Hqx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABuFI4Bcs3qsOyHo7c1ChRCyF5gqVDVzX0,NAME_SEARCH,QuMN)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBN03wBzYumpxqZTYx9DgZOu5zKvo0LdF8,NAME_SEARCH,Hddz)"}]},{"name":"A Computational Approach to Predict Lyophilizaiton Performance and Monitor Process Robustness for Biologics","publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2014},"publisher":"2014 AiChe Annual Meeting","url":"http:\/\/www3.aiche.org\/proceedings\/AuthorDetails.aspx?PersonID=152701","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANggBoB0y9pTiNRq_qeNuDONgta7dfOssE,NAME_SEARCH,-Hqx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBN03wBzYumpxqZTYx9DgZOu5zKvo0LdF8,NAME_SEARCH,Hddz)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2014},"description":"Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving therapy for patients with severe lung disorders, the microbubble flows generated during ventilation generate hydrodynamic stresses, including pressure and shear stress gradients, which damage the pulmonary epithelium.

Direct interface tracking and finite element techniques were used to simulate bubble propagation in a two-dimensional (2D) liquid-filled bifurcating airway. Computational solutions of the full incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation were used to investigate how inertia, gravity, and surface tension forces as characterized by the Reynolds (Re), Bond (Bo), and Capillary (Ca) numbers influence pressure and shear stress gradients at the airway wall. Gravity had a significant impact on flow patterns and hydrodynamic stress magnitudes where Bo\u2009>\u20091 led to dramatic changes in bubble shape and increased pressure and shear stress gradients in the upper daughter airway. Interestingly, increased pressure gradients near the bifurcation point (i.e., carina) were only elevated during asymmetric bubble splitting. Although changes in pressure gradient magnitudes were generally more sensitive to Ca, under large Re conditions, both Re and Ca significantly altered the pressure gradient magnitude. We conclude that inertia, gravity, and surface tension can all have a significant impact on microbubble flow patterns and hydrodynamic stresses in bifurcating airways.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4151161\/","name":"Computational Analysis of Microbubble Flows in Bifurcating Airways: Role of Gravity, Inertia, and Surface Tension","publisher":"J Biomech Eng","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANggBoB0y9pTiNRq_qeNuDONgta7dfOssE,NAME_SEARCH,-Hqx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbXjrUBrYpMAueCMifzehP_lvIMNyxsdYk,NAME_SEARCH,OO8D)"}]},{"name":"Simulating Microbubble Flows Using COMSOL Multiphysics","publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2008},"description":" We utilized COMSOL with Matlab to develop a time dependent computational model of semi-infinite air bubble progression in a liquid filled channel.

The objective of this paper is to provide some mechanistic understanding about the contribution of electrostatic repulsion to the viscosity of protein solutions at high concentrations, along with the effect of excipients such as salts on relative viscosity. Proteins are treated as charged colloids in this paper. At high concentrations, the electrical double layer starts to overlap, and secondary electroviscous effect becomes significant in addition to primary electroviscous effect. In other words, the hydrodynamic volume of proteins plays a great role in influencing their solution viscosity because of the excluded volume effect. Currently, it is hypothesized that the high viscosity of concentrated protein solutions is attributed to formation of clusters due to either electrostatic attraction or hydrophobic interactions, especially for monoclonal antibodies, in which anybody molecules in high concentration formulations may form networks. Consequently, viscosity reduction in the presence of inorganic or organic salts in these formulations is due to breaking up of these networks. In this review, authors hope to provide another point of view based on the effect of the electrostatic repulsion on the excluded volume-hydrodynamic volume. Finally, authors hope the proposed theoretical framework can be used to guide excipient selection in the product development of highly concentrated proteins.

When proteins come in contact with vapor-liquid, solid-liquid, and liquid-liquid surfaces, these interfaces can significantly impact the protein drug product quality attributes, including formation of visible particles, subvisible particles, or soluble aggregates, or changes in target protein concentration due to adsorption of the molecule to various interfaces. Protein aggregation at interfaces is often accompanied by changes in conformation, as proteins modify their higher order structure in response to interfacial stresses such as hydrophobicity, charge, and mechanical stress. Formation of aggregates may elicit immunogenicity concerns; therefore, it is important to minimize opportunities for aggregation by performing a systematic evaluation of interfacial stress throughout the product development cycle and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. The purpose of this white paper is to provide an understanding of protein interfacial stability, explore methods to understand interfacial behavior of proteins, then describe current industry approaches to address interfacial stability concerns. Specifically, we will discuss interfacial stresses to which proteins are exposed from drug substance manufacture through clinical administration, as well as the analytical techniques used to evaluate the resulting impact on the stability of the protein. A high-level mechanistic understanding of the relationship between interfacial stress and aggregation will be introduced, as well as some novel techniques for measuring and better understanding the interfacial behavior of proteins.
