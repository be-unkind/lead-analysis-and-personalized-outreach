To re-entrain these solids, the detachment behavior of closely-fitting particles from microchannel walls must be understood. Experiments were completed to examine the effects of particle size and material interactions on particle detachment velocity. Studies were conducted for various sizes of glass and poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, spheres in glass and poly(dimethyl siloxane), PDMS, microfluidic channels. In addition, an inexpensive method to produce monodisperse PMMA microparticles was developed. To analyze the effect of material interactions, the work of adhesion between the particle and the channel wall was calculated. The fluid velocity required to detach a particle was found to be relatively constant until the particle-to-channel diameter ratio approached approximately 50%, after which detachment velocity decreased with increasing particle size. Particles in a glass microchannel experienced significantly more adhesion than those in PDMS channels.","url":"http:\/\/scholar.rose-hulman.edu\/chemical_engineering_grad_theses\/4\/","name":"The Influence of Relative Particle Size and Material Interactions on the Flow-Induced Detachment of Particles from a Microchannel","publisher":"Rose-Hulman Scholar","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAiZtbcB2zNa831xJPQx4RAQcUzIp9GpCNY,NAME_SEARCH,pbvL)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":16,"year":2018},"description":"Tensile mechanics of double-network (DN) hydrogels synthesized from 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) and acrylamide (AAm) with different cross-link density of the first networks was studied after applying the freeze\/thaw (F\/T) process. When a DN hydrogel which exhibits necking upon applying a tensile load undergoes F\/T process, necking is suppressed and strain hardening is observed in a tensile deformation. The area under the stress\u2013strain curve which measures the work of deformation and is a criterion of toughness also is reduced after the F\/T process. The reduction of toughness in a DN hydrogel with more brittle first network is more pronounced. The toughness of samples reduced very markedly after the first F\/T cycle; however, the toughness of the samples was very close after the second and third F\/T cycles. The reduction of mechanical properties of DN hydrogels upon applying the F\/T process is attributed to the damage induced by freezing of water to the internal structure of hydrogel by breaking the chemical bonds. The water content of DN hydrogels increased after the F\/T process which is consistent with the hypothesis of damage induced by freezing of water. DN hydrogels immersed in liquid nitrogen for a fast freezing process shattered into small pieces, and cracks appeared on the pieces.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.macromol.7b02418","name":"Effect of Freeze\/Thaw Process on Mechanical Behavior of Double-Network Hydrogels in Finite Tensile Deformation","publisher":"Macromolecules","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAiZtbcB2zNa831xJPQx4RAQcUzIp9GpCNY,NAME_SEARCH,pbvL)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716685500000,"insightId":"fbb42bc0-769e-43f4-b792-9a8f74304c11","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:job:3933977615"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":24},{"type":"PRAISE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7200301102624370688","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7200301102624370688","reactionsCount":25,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7200301102083244033","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"I\u2019m hiring an engineer to join Verve\u2019s LNP formulation group!"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7200301102083244033"}}}]}
