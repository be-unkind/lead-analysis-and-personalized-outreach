The cause was cancer, and he was 86. \u201cLubert was one of the most inspirational, dedicated and genuinely wonderful people I have had the privilege of knowing,\u201d said\u00a0 Lloyd Minor , MD, dean of the Stanford School of Medicine and vice president for medical affairs at Stanford University. \u201cHe was truly a polymath in his understanding of various fields of science and his ability to bring different techniques and approaches to the questions he sought to answer. I can think of no one who better exemplifies the values of academic excellence and scientific impact.\u201d Stryer is widely remembered for his rigorous science and pedagogical skill, but those who knew him also recall a warm and generous friend, a kind but demanding mentor, a stimulating colleague, and a teacher who was a lifelong learner. \u201cLubert had an extraordinary intellect coupled with an insatiable curiosity,\u201d said Lucy Shapiro , PhD, a professor emerita of developmental biology. \u201cMost of us lose the childhood wonder and awe of the biological and physical world, but Lubert never did. He had an uncanny ability to communicate his vast store of knowledge to students of all ages with clarity, precision and joy.\u201d Light was the leitmotif throughout Stryer\u2019s four-decade career. In the 1960s, as a young assistant professor at Stanford Medicine, he experimentally proved F\u00f6rster\u2019s theorem, which posited that the efficiency of energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules depended on the distance between them. Stryer and colleagues showed that this phenomenon could be employed as a spectroscopic ruler to measure the tiny distances \u2014 typically a few nanometers \u2014 between sites on a protein tagged with light-sensitive molecules. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has since developed into an essential tool used in thousands of studies to elucidate the structure of proteins and nucleic acids and their interactions with each other. In the 1970s, Stryer turned his attention to the mechanism of vision, specifically the mystery of how our eyes can process small amounts of light into a visual signal. Rhodopsin, a light-sensing protein in photoreceptor cells of the retina, was known to change shape in response to a single photon. Stryer\u2019s team discovered that each photo-excited rhodopsin molecule then activates about 500 molecules of another protein, which they named transducin , greatly amplifying the signal that leads to vision. Remarkably similar amplification mechanisms have been identified in other biological processes, such as the body\u2019s response to hormones. \u201cThis was an amazing revelation,\u201d said Jeremy Nathans, MD, PhD, a former graduate student at Stanford Medicine who was inspired by Stryer\u2019s work on vision. \u201cIt speaks to an extremely ancient system, which has now been repurposed for many different physiological functions.\u201d Nathans is now a professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, studying the genetics of vision. These two fundamental discoveries, FRET and signal amplification in vision, established Stryer\u2019s scientific legacy. In 1989, Stryer took a one-year hiatus from Stanford Medicine to help found Affymax, a biotech company that used light to\u00a0 generate \u00a0microarrays containing hundreds of thousands of synthetic compounds for drug discovery. He later led the scientific advisory board at Affymetrix, a spinoff company that found spectacular success in manufacturing thumbnail-sized DNA chips for high-speed genetic analysis. He earned a reputation as a stellar educator, both in print and in person. \u201cLubert was a fantastic lecturer, the kind where you come out of the lecture and say to yourself, \u2018That\u2019s the best lecture I\u2019ve ever heard,\u2019\u201d Nathans said. Stryer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He received the American Chemical Society Award in Biological Chemistry, the American Association for the Advancement of Science Newcomb Cleveland Prize, the European Inventor of the Year Award and an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/med.stanford.edu\/news\/all-news\/2024\/05\/lubert-stryer--luminary-scientist-of-light-and-life--author-of-c.html","title":"Lubert Stryer, luminary scientist of light and life, author of classic textbook, dies at 86"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7192579314821877760","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192579314821877760","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7192579312649175042","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ggu6UbNR"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/ggu6UbNR"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7192579312649175042"}}},{"createdAt":1714149780000,"insightId":"fe338ad9-a0d1-4ac5-88a4-ba8f172dcde7","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":9}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7189351922938580994,7189665479081320451)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7189351922938580994","reactionsCount":9,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Hi Sean, you\u2019re a brilliant scientist, great manger with caring heart.
