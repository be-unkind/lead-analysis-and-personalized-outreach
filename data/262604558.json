Healthy, community dwelling, cognitively intact elders (n5 156, mean age at entry583 years) were examined annually for an average of greater than 7 years. Those who developed at least two consecutive Clinical Dementia Ratings? 0.5 were classified as having MCI. Longitudinal mixed effects models with a change point were used to model the aging process in those with and without an MCI diagnosis\nduring follow-up and to model the rate of change relative to the age of onset of MCI. MCI had a preclinical stage of accelerated cognitive loss that was observed 3 to 4 years before the diagnosis of MCI on tests of verbal memory, animal fluency, and visuospatial constructions. Evidence from memory performance before the change point suggests that a slow decline in memory precedes the period of accelerated decline in the development of MCI. Aging transitions leading to MCI and dementia are characterized by unique linear and nonlinear cognitive changes in several domains that precede the diagnosis of MCI and dementia by at least several years.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18282317","name":"Trajectory of Mild Cognitive Impairment Onset","publisher":"Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA-nBw4BsajBCB-pyl7i2Vk0152yHPQrexE,NAME_SEARCH,xtwq)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716488220000,"insightId":"f15e8e4b-685a-4d03-9b92-7b9a1e1a3699","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"description":"Timely Topics: Live from Marquam Hill: Experience the powerful story of one man\u2019s battle with Alzheimer\u2019s and his efforts to slow its progression.","fullText":"Unlike most patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Daniel Gibbs, M.D., R '89, Ph.D. is a neurologist.
