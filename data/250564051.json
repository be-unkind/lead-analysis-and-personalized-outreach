We induced Cd tolerance in Daphnia pulex after exposing them for 25 generations and examined the maintenance of enhanced Cd tolerance under a Cd-free environment for an additional three generations.

Butyltin compounds (BTs), especially tributyltin (TBT), are considered to be endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine organisms. The underlying mechanism of disrupting effects on mammals, however, has not been sufficiently investigated. To determine the effect and action of these biocides, the present study evaluated the effects of BTs on human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295R) with a focus on endocrine disrupting effect. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and subsequent mass finger printing were used to identify proteins expression profiles from the cells after exposure to 0.1 \u03bcM BTs for 48 h. In total, 89 protein spots showed altered expression in at least two treatment groups and 69 of these proteins were subsequently identified. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins indicated that BTs involved in the regulation of hormone homeostasis, lipid metabolism, cell death, and energy production. IPA analysis revealed LXR\/RXR (liver X receptor\/retinoid X receptor) activation, FXR\/RXR (farnesoid X receptor\/retinoid X receptor) activation and fatty acid metabolism were the top three categories on which BTs acted and these systems play vital roles in sterol, glucose and lipid metabolism. The expression of LXR and FXR mRNA in H295R cells was stimulated by TBT, confirming the ability of TBT to activate this nuclear receptor. In summary, the differentially expressed proteins discovered in this study may participate in the toxic actions of BTs, and nuclear receptor activation and lipid metabolism may play important roles in such actions of BTs.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969718305576","name":"Insight into the endocrine disrupting effect and cell response to butyltin compounds in H295R cell: Evaluated with proteomics and bioinformatics analysis","publisher":"Science of The Total Environment","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7vTdMBTLLMKaoEvDn_zmRvMNqpt9XbQSo,NAME_SEARCH,VauS)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":1,"year":2017},"description":"Pathogen introductions associated with aquatic invasive species threaten ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide.

Exposure to 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen agonist commonly found in sewage effluents, has been shown to cause gonadal changes in male gonochoristic fish ranging from gonadal intersex to complete sex reversal. Although these gonadal changes have been well studied in Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes, the molecular mechanisms behind them are poorly understood. Our objective was to study the signaling pathways elicited by exposure to different concentrations of EE2 in this species. Embryos and larvae were sexed by the presence of leucophores and dmy expression (only in males). Male medaka were exposed to two EE2 concentrations (30 and 300\u2009ng\/L) during their gonadal differentiation period (7 \u2013 22 dpf). The transcriptome of larvae was analyzed using RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis. Genes involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., cldn19, ctbp1, hsd17b4) showed a female-like expression pattern in EE2-exposed males with some genes changing in expression in an EE2 concentration-dependent manner. However, not all genes known to be involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., wnt4b) were altered by EE2. Several of the prominently affected signaling pathways involved genes associated with steroidogenesis, steroid receptor signaling and steroid metabolism, such as cyp2b3, cyp3b40, cyp1a, hsd17b4. We also report on novel genes and pathways affected that might play a role in gonadal changes, including several genes associated with FXR\/RXR and LXR\/RXR activation networks. This study is the first to examine the transcriptomic changes in male fish resulting from exposure to EE2 during the gonadal differentiation period, providing new insights on the signaling pathways involved in the development of gonadal changes in gonochoristic fish.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0166445X18309214","name":"Molecular signaling pathways elicited by 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol in Japanese medaka male larvae undergoing gonadal differentiation","publisher":"Aquatic Toxicology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7vTdMBTLLMKaoEvDn_zmRvMNqpt9XbQSo,NAME_SEARCH,VauS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANDCVUBLJ9iYKmKHZNpLoTqLAN9R4SeKp8,NAME_SEARCH,ZCBh)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwJNcBTAng9O0-pvYKk1DLFxsbOMh0TCA,NAME_SEARCH,iifl)"}]},{"name":"Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Abiotic Stressors on Fundulus grandis Cardiac Transcriptomics","publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":31,"year":2020},"publisher":"Science of the Total Environment","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0048969720356850","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7vTdMBTLLMKaoEvDn_zmRvMNqpt9XbQSo,NAME_SEARCH,VauS)"}]},{"name":"The influence of hypoxia on the cardiac transcriptomes of two estuarine species - C. variegatus and F. grandis","publishedOn":{"month":6,"year":2020},"publisher":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology - Part D: Genomics and Proteomics","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1744117X21000496","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7vTdMBTLLMKaoEvDn_zmRvMNqpt9XbQSo,NAME_SEARCH,VauS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANDCVUBLJ9iYKmKHZNpLoTqLAN9R4SeKp8,NAME_SEARCH,ZCBh)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1713874140000,"insightId":"fcefc65b-572b-455b-ab62-0c2e7b7189b8","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7188509200644210688","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7188509200644210688","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7188509200187109376","message":{"attributes":[],"text":""},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"description":"Data Science Policy & Engagement Lead","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/careers.novonordisk.com\/job\/Lexington-Data-Science-Policy-&-Engagement-Lead-MA-02420\/1063596101\/?feedId=300201&utm_source=LinkedInJobPostings&tcsource=Apply&utm_campaign=Novo_Nordisk_LinkedIn","title":"Data Science Policy & Engagement Lead"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7188508267701055488","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Join our team!
