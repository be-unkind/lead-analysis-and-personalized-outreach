These enzymes catalyse the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to deoxynucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs) In the class Ia RNRs, NDP reduction involves a tyrosyl radical mediated oxidation occurring over 35 \u00c5 across the interface of the two required subunits (\u03b22 and \u03b12) involving multiple PCET steps and the conserved tyrosine triad [Y356(\u03b22)\u2013Y731(\u03b12) \u2013Y730(\u03b12)]. We report the synthesis of an active photochemical RNR (photoRNR) complex in which a Re(I)-tricarbonyl phenanthroline ([Re]) photooxidant is attached site-specifically to the Cys in the Y356C-(\u03b22) subunit and an ionizable, 2,3,5-trifluorotyrosine (2,3,5-F3Y) is incorporated in place of Y731 in \u03b12. This intersubunit PCET pathway is investigated by ns laser spectroscopy on [Re356]-\u03b22:2,3,5-F3Y731-\u03b12 in the presence of substrate, CDP, and effector, ATP. This experiment has allowed analysis of the photoinjection of a radical into \u03b12 from \u03b22 in the absence of the interfacial Y356 residue. The system is competent for light-dependent substrate turnover. Time-resolved emission experiments reveal an intimate dependence of the rate of radical injection on the protonation state at position Y731(\u03b12), which in turn highlights the importance of a well-coordinated proton exit channel involving the key residues, Y356 and Y731, at the subunit interface.","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/C5SC01125F","name":"Direct Interfacial Y731 Oxidation in \u03b12 by a Photo\u03b22 Subunit of E. coli Class Ia Ribonucleotide Reductase","publisher":"Chemical Science","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOMJigBIfJIh9LG1H3l4yFgaoPv_bYJHM8,NAME_SEARCH,gRts)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAekzIUBJePhqZRSaOmkzeUUysasLeEfuIM,NAME_SEARCH,SAGG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAK7vU0BsXgTKy_ZhAL-2xgnqV18h8qOUYE,NAME_SEARCH,D-lh)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":19,"year":2015},"description":"There is a need for facile chemistries that allow for chemo- and regioselectivity in bioconjugation reactions.

Site-specific payload placement allows for control over both the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and the conjugation site, both of which play an important role in governing the pharmacokinetics (PK), disposition, and efficacy of the ADC. In addition to the DAR and site of conjugation, linker composition also plays an important role in the properties of an ADC. We have previously reported a novel site-specific conjugation platform comprising linker payloads designed to selectively react with site-specifically engineered aldehyde tags on an antibody backbone. This chemistry results in a stable C-C bond between the antibody and the cytotoxin payload, providing a uniquely stable connection with respect to the other linker chemistries used to generate ADCs. The flexibility and versatility of the aldehyde tag conjugation platform has enabled us to undertake a systematic evaluation of the impact of conjugation site and linker composition on ADC properties. Here, we describe the production and characterization of a panel of ADCs bearing the aldehyde tag at different locations on an IgG1 backbone conjugated using Hydrazino-iso-Pictet-Spengler (HIPS) chemistry.

Cytokines play important roles in cancer initiation, progression, and elimination, and thus, there is a long clinical history associated with the use of recombinant cytokines to treat cancer. However, the use of cytokines as therapeutics has been limited by cytokine pleiotropy, complex biology, poor drug-like properties, and severe dose-limiting toxicities. Nevertheless, cytokines are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity and have the potential to enhance immunotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer. Development of immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination immunotherapies has reinvigorated interest in cytokines as therapeutics, and a variety of engineering approaches are emerging to improve the safety and effectiveness of cytokine immunotherapy. In this review we highlight recent advances in cytokine biology and engineering for cancer immunotherapy.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.addr.2022.114112","name":"Engineering interferons and interleukins for cancer immunotherapy","publisher":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOMJigBIfJIh9LG1H3l4yFgaoPv_bYJHM8,NAME_SEARCH,gRts)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADh-IYBChDhifXcQiijJJa8QXvWJGB7MVU,NAME_SEARCH,McxX)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAO7nR8Bt95_Fo7P4BaAUtLZdzGLe73KxyY,NAME_SEARCH,J6OA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAyjlzMBobi3LzYWmPRLIpsi46vp0tDNDzs,NAME_SEARCH,OJbg)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFytKwBnZ12GP5Zb_mElV2WjTo20FJs5fU,NAME_SEARCH,GT6m)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAs6vwEBp2iK6TalsO4TSbT8VHC6EATobnY,NAME_SEARCH,Q3Po)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":16,"year":2020},"description":"Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are a therapeutic modality that traditionally enable the targeted delivery of highly potent cytotoxic agents to specific cells such as tumor cells. More recently, antibodies have been used to deliver molecules such as antibiotics, antigens, and adjuvants to bacteria or specific immune cell subsets. Site-directed mutagenesis of proteins permits more precise control over the site and stoichiometry of their conjugation, giving rise to homogeneous chemically defined ADCs. Identification of favorable sites for conjugation in antibodies is essential as reaction efficiency and product stability are influenced by the tertiary structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Current methods to evaluate potential conjugation sites are time-consuming and labor intensive, involving multistep processes for individually produced reactions. Here, we describe a highly efficient method for identification of conjugatable genetic variants by analyzing pooled ADC libraries using mass spectrometry. This approach provides a versatile platform to rapidly uncover new conjugation sites for site-specific ADCs.","url":"http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.0c00146","name":"High-Throughput Platform to Identify Antibody Conjugation Sites from Antibody-Drug Conjugate Libraries","publisher":"Bioconjugate Chem","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOMJigBIfJIh9LG1H3l4yFgaoPv_bYJHM8,NAME_SEARCH,gRts)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":15,"year":2020},"description":"We describe a class of bioconjugation reactions that enables site-specific modification of proteins through enzymatic generation of o-quinone from either tyrosine residues or phenol reagents.

These agents are usually administered via intravitreal injection at a dosing interval of 4\u20138 weeks. Employment of long-acting delivery (LAD) technologies could improve the therapeutic outcome, ensure timely treatment, and reduce burden on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Development of LAD approaches requires thorough testing in pre-clinical species; however, therapeutic proteins of human origin may not be well tolerated during testing in non-human species due to immunogenicity. Here, we have engineered a surrogate porcine antibody Fab fragment (pigG6.31) from a human antibody for testing ocular LAD technologies in a porcine model. The engineered Fab retains the VEGF-A-binding and inhibition properties of the parental human Fab and has stability properties suitable for LAD evaluation. Upon intravitreal injection in minipigs, pigG6.31 showed first-order clearance from the ocular compartments with vitreal elimination rates consistent with other molecules of this size. Application of the surrogate molecule in an in vivo evaluation in minipigs of a prototype of the port delivery (PD) platform indicated continuous ocular delivery from the implant, with release kinetics consistent with both the results from in vitro release studies and the efficacy observed in human clinical studies of the PD system with ranibizumab (PDS). Anti-drug antibodies in the serum against pigG6.31 were not detected over exposure durations up to 16 weeks, suggesting that this molecule has low porcine immunogenicity.","url":"http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00048","name":"Generation of a Porcine Antibody Fab Fragment Using Protein Engineering to Facilitate the Evaluation of Ocular Sustained Delivery Technology","publisher":"Mol Pharm.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOMJigBIfJIh9LG1H3l4yFgaoPv_bYJHM8,NAME_SEARCH,gRts)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":18,"year":2022},"description":"CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated proteins (Cas) are powerful gene-editing tools used in therapeutic applications. Efforts to minimize off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9 have motivated the development of engineered Cas9 variants. The wild-type (WT) Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been engineered into a high-fidelity Cas9 (SpyFi Cas9) that shows promising results in providing high on-target activity (targeting efficiency) while reducing off-target editing (unwanted mutations). This work describes for the first time the development of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based methods for a full characterization of different engineered Cas9 variants, including determination of purity, size variants, isoelectric points (pI), post-translational modifications (PTMs), and functional activities. The purity and size variant characterization were first determined by CE-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). An in vitro DNA cleavage assay using an automated electrophoresis tool was employed to investigate the functional activity of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes derived from Cas9 variants. The pIs of the engineered Cas9 proteins were determined by imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF), while intact mass measurements were performed by reversed-phase (RP)-UHPLC coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). A peptide mapping assay based on LC-UV-MS\/MS using endoproteinase Lys-C under non-reducing conditions was developed to confirm amino acid sequences, allowing differentiation of SpyFi Cas9 from WT SpCas9. The potential of using a low-resolution MS detector, especially for a GMP environment, as a low-cost and simple method to identify SpyFi Cas9 is discussed.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.talanta.2022.123780","name":"Comprehensive UHPLC- and CE-Based Methods for Engineered Cas9 Characterization","publisher":"Talanta","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOMJigBIfJIh9LG1H3l4yFgaoPv_bYJHM8,NAME_SEARCH,gRts)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":20,"year":2023},"description":"XmAb24306 is a lymphoproliferative interleukin (IL)-15\/IL-15 receptor \u03b1 (IL-15R\u03b1) Fc-fusion protein currently under clinical investigation as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment. XmAb24306 contains mutations in IL-15 that attenuate its affinity to the heterodimeric IL-15 receptor \u03b2\u03b3 (IL-15R). We observe substantially prolonged pharmacokinetics (PK) (half-life \u223c 2.5 to 4.5 days) in single- and repeat-dose cynomolgus monkey (cyno) studies compared to wild-type IL-15 (half-life \u223c 1 hour), leading to increased exposure and enhanced and durable expansion of NK cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4\u2013CD8\u2013 (double negative [DN]) T cells. Drug clearance varied with dose level and time post-dose, and PK exposure decreased upon repeated dosing, which we attribute to increased target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) resulting from drug-induced lymphocyte expansion (i.e., pharmacodynamic (PD)-enhanced TMDD). We developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to quantify the complex PKPD behaviors due to the interactions of XmAb24306 with multiple cell types (CD8+, CD4+, DN T cells, and NK cells) in the peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid tissues. The model, which includes nonspecific drug clearance, binding to and TMDD by IL15R differentially expressed on lymphocyte subsets, and resultant lymphocyte margination\/migration out of PB, expansion in lymphoid tissues, and redistribution to the blood, successfully describes the systemic PK and lymphocyte kinetics observed in the cyno studies. Results suggest that after 3 doses of every-two-week (Q2W) doses up to 70 days, the relative contributions of each elimination pathway to XmAb24306 clearance are: DN T cells > NK cells > CD8+ T cells > nonspecific clearance > CD4+ T cells.
