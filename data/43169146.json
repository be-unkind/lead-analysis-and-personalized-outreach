In this investigation, we compared the antiproliferative activity of two PARP\/putative PARP inhibitors, i.e., olaparib and iniparib, in a panel of 14 breast cancer cell lines (seven tripe-negative and seven non-triple-negative). In almost all cell lines investigated, olaparib was a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than iniparib. Inhibition by both drugs was cell line-dependent and independent of the molecular subtype status of the cells, i.e., whether cells were triple-negative or non-triple negative. Although the primary target of PARP inhibitors is PARP1, no significant association was found between baseline levels of PARP1 activity and inhibition with either agent. Similarly, no significant correlation was evident between sensitivity and levels of CDK1, BRCA1 or miR-182. Combined addition of olaparib and either the CDK1 inhibitor, RO-3306 or a pan HER inhibitor (neratinib, afatinib) resulted in superior growth inhibition to that obtained with olaparib alone. We conclude that olaparib, in contrast to iniparib, is a strong inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth and may have efficacy in breast cancer irrespective of its molecular subtype, i.e., whether HER2-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or triple-negative.

Adenocarcinoma (ADC), a subtype of NSCLC, is the single biggest cancer killer and therefore an urgent need to identify minimally invasive biomarkers to enable early diagnosis. Recent studies, by ourselves and others, indicate that circulating miRNAs have potential as biomarkers. Here we applied global profiling approaches in serum from patients with ADC of the lung to explore if miRNAs have potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This study involved RNA isolation from 80 sera specimens including those from ADC patients (equal numbers of Stages 1, 2, 3, and 4) and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 40 each). 667 miRNAs were co-analyzed in these specimens using TaqMan low density arrays and qPCR validation using individual miRNAs. Overall, approximately 390 and 370 miRNAs were detected in ADC and control sera, respectively. A group of 6 miRNAs, miR-30c-1* (AUC = 0.74; p<0.002), miR-616* (AUC = 0.71; p = 0.001), miR-146b-3p (AUC = 0.82; p<0.0001), miR-566 (AUC = 0.80; p<0.0001), miR-550 (AUC = 0.72; p = 0.0006), and miR-939 (AUC = 0.82; p<0.0001) was found to be present at substantially higher levels in ADC compared with control sera. Conversely, miR-339-5p and miR-656 were detected at substantially lower levels in ADC sera (co-analysis resulting in AUC = 0.6; p = 0.02). Differences in miRNA profile identified support circulating miRNAs having potential as diagnostic biomarkers for ADC.

Directly irradiated cells and bystander cells can communicate with each other using gap junctional intercellular communication or by releasing soluble factors into the surrounding medium. Exosomes and microvesicles are also known to mediate communication between cells. The main aim of this study is to establish whether exosomes and microvesicles are involved in radiation induced bystander signaling. Human keratinocytes, HaCaT cells, were irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) using \u03b3 rays produced from a cobalt 60 teletherapy unit. After irradiation, the cells were incubated for 1 h and the irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) was harvested. Exosomes were isolated from the ICCM using ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were characterized using light scattering analysis (LSA) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species assays and real time calcium imaging were performed either with ICCM from which exosomes and microvesicles were removed or with the exosome fraction resuspended in cell culture media. The characterization data showed a particle size distribution indicative of both exosomes (30-100 nm) and microvesicles (>100 nm) and the light scattering analysis showed increased concentration of both exosomes and microvesicles with increasing dose. Western blotting confirmed the presence of an exosomal protein marker, TSG 101. Treatment of unirradiated cells with ICCM in which exosomes and microvesicles were removed resulted in abrogation of ICCM induced effects such as reduction in viability, calcium influx and production of reactive oxygen species. Addition of exosomes to fresh media produced similar effects to complete ICCM. These results suggest a role for exosomes and microvesicles in radiation induced bystander signaling.

Finally, our pilot translational study showed that exosomes from TNBC patients' sera significantly increased recipient cells' invasion when compared to those derived from age- and gender-matched healthy control sera.\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis study supports the hypothesis that TNBC exosomes may be involved in cancer cell-to-cell communication, conferring phenotypic traits to secondary cells that reflect those of their cells of origin.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23453937","name":"Exosomes from triple-negative breast cancer cells can transfer phenotypic traits representing their cells of origin to secondary cells","publisher":"Eur J Cancer.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2GX3wBPCzWbN_7dPAF4aDBac1XcuHhRg8,NAME_SEARCH,cm4E)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKStXoB0nzifIDfEyAEcBDUaB8hk8Vjb7I,NAME_SEARCH,ZARz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmDHDwBKGh8QdbDfvCO-snqM9A908EI8jU,NAME_SEARCH,VQlb)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2011},"description":"A typical microarray experiment results in series of images, depending on the experimental design and number of samples.

NmU overexpression occurred in cells with acquired or innate resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib, all of which displayed a similar trend upon short-term exposure, suggesting NmU induction may be an early response. An analysis of 3,489 cases of breast cancer showed NmU to be associated with poor patient outcome, particularly those with HER2-overexpressing tumors independent of established prognostic indicators. Ectopic overexpression of NmU in drug-sensitive cells conferred resistance to all HER-targeting drugs, whereas RNAi-mediated attenuation sensitized cells exhibiting acquired or innate drug resistance. Our results defined NmU as a candidate drug response biomarker for HER2-overexpressing cancers and as a candidate therapeutic target to limit metastatic progression and improve the efficacy of HER-targeted drugs.","publisher":"Cancer Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKStXoB0nzifIDfEyAEcBDUaB8hk8Vjb7I,NAME_SEARCH,ZARz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmDHDwBKGh8QdbDfvCO-snqM9A908EI8jU,NAME_SEARCH,VQlb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAPLs9wBiMbD2SfcwQSyt4KpqYCdKvT9WaU,NAME_SEARCH,X8JV)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASZKMUBoJ7oAxoX-Ax40xGhjgWqwX1IPvw,NAME_SEARCH,yimj)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABd9DIUBEqkxNxlHTW6JHdCSz6obqPrwF2A,NAME_SEARCH,9-YH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASYVuMB9F0U4QjJjFu6P4Tz2YJjzSODDzI,NAME_SEARCH,CEcn)"}]},{"name":"Analysis of changes in phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases: antibody arrays.","description":"Tyrosine kinases are mainly classified into two groups, as receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK).

Much of the current interest in therapeutic application of MSCs to various disease settings can be linked to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. One of the key mechanisms of MSC anti-inflammatory effects is the secretion of soluble factors with paracrine actions. Recently it has emerged that the paracrine functions of MSCs could, at least in part, be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs).\n\nEVs are predominantly released from the endosomal compartment and contain a cargo that includes miRNA, mRNA and proteins from their cells of origin. Recent animal model-based studies suggest that EVs have significant potential as a novel alternative to whole cell therapies. Compared to their parent cells, EVs may have a superior safety profile and can be safely stored without losing function. In this article we review current knowledge related to the potential use of MSC-derived EVs in various diseases and discuss the promising future for EVs as an alternative, cell-free therapy.","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mt\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/mt201544a.html","name":"Mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles: Towards cell-free therapeutic applications","publisher":"Molecular Therapy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKStXoB0nzifIDfEyAEcBDUaB8hk8Vjb7I,NAME_SEARCH,ZARz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATH1-kBv-34zxBuYdMLNy-BRcJ2blAwjwM,NAME_SEARCH,b9NZ)"}]},{"name":"Oral Presentation in International Conference (\u00a7invited talk; *awards):","description":"1.\t\u00a7Rani S, O\u2019 Malley GA, Lohan P, Murphy CC, Ryan A, Griffin MD and Ritter T: Topical application of extracellular vesicles: a novel approach to prevent inflammatory skin and eye diseases: 17th-18th September 2014, The HELIX, Dublin City University\n2.\tRani S, Germano S, Kennedy S, Crown J, O\u2019Driscoll L: Clinical significance and functional relevance of melanoma-associated antigen family protein\u2013D4 (MAGED-4) in breast cancer: Discover Research Night: Dublin, Ireland, Friday, 27th September 2013.\n3.\tRani S, O\u2019Brien K, O\u2019Donovan N, Crown J, O\u2019Driscoll L: Role of exosome in acquired resistance to HER-targeted therapies in breast cancer: Microvesicles and Exosomes in Health and Disease: Dublin, Ireland, Friday 17th May 2013.\n4.\tRani S, O\u2019Brien K, O\u2019Donovan N, Crown J, O\u2019Driscoll L: Exosome-mediated response to her-targeted therapies in breast cancer: IACR, Dublin, Ireland: 27 Feb-1 March 2013.\n5.\tRani S, O\u2019Driscoll L: Neuromedin U: a novel target to overcome resistance to HER-targeted therapies and a potential predictive biomarker: TBSI Research Day, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, 18 Sept 2012.\n6.\t*1Rani S, Germano S, Kennedy S, Gleeson G, Clynes M, Doolan P, McDonnell S, Hughes L, Crown J, O\u2019Driscoll L: Investigating clinical and functional relevance of MAGE-D4B in Breast cancer: RAMI Biomedical Sciences Annual Meeting, Ireland, 22 June, 2011.\n7.\tRani S, Germano S,  Kennedy S, Clynes M, Crown J, O'Driscoll L: MAGE-D4B in Breast Cancer: assessment of Intracellular & Extracellular relevance: MTCI Breast Cancer Symposium: Dublin: Nov 2010.\n8.\tRani S, Mehta JP, Doolan P, Barron N, Jeppesen PB, Clynes M, O\u2019Driscoll L: Txnip-identified as a regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reactive oxygen species in MIN6 cells: \u201cTranslational Research\u201d: Applying molecular insights from laboratory discovery to clinical care, Ireland, June 23-24, 2010: published in IJMS.\n","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKStXoB0nzifIDfEyAEcBDUaB8hk8Vjb7I,NAME_SEARCH,ZARz)"}]},{"name":"miR-134 in extracellular vesicles reduces triple-negative breast cancer aggression and increases drug sensitivity.","publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":24,"year":2015},"publisher":"Oncotarget","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26416415\/?i=1&from=mir-134","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKStXoB0nzifIDfEyAEcBDUaB8hk8Vjb7I,NAME_SEARCH,ZARz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2GX3wBPCzWbN_7dPAF4aDBac1XcuHhRg8,NAME_SEARCH,cm4E)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAmDHDwBKGh8QdbDfvCO-snqM9A908EI8jU,NAME_SEARCH,VQlb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABQsuMwB7evoRf1LI5Vo80-PwowyfjSBNns, , )"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABHS4pUBcJBmMzZVvG0oyt2OVPwQvzF9WYQ,NAME_SEARCH,drl1)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":17,"year":2015},"description":"Wound healing is a complex process and often delayed in patients with underlying chronic conditions.
