PML also has an important role in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show the involvement of the helicase HAGE in the transcriptional repression of PML expression in ABCB5+ malignant melanoma-initiating cells (ABCB5+ MMICs), a population of cancer stem cells which are responsible for melanoma growth, progression and resistance to drug-based therapy. HAGE prevents PML gene expression by inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT (janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway in a mechanism which implicates the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1). Knockdown of HAGE led to a significant decrease in SOCS1 protein expression, activation of the JAK-STAT signalling cascade and a consequent increase of PML expression. To confirm that the reduction in SOCS1 expression was dependent on the HAGE helicase activity, we showed that SOCS1, effectively silenced by small interfering RNA, could be rescued by re-introduction of HAGE into cells lacking HAGE. Furthermore, we provide a mechanism by which HAGE promotes SOCS1 mRNA unwinding and protein expression in vitro. Finally, using a stem cell proliferation assay and tumour xenotransplantation assay in non-obese diabetic\/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, we show that HAGE promotes MMICs-dependent tumour initiation and tumour growth by preventing the anti-proliferative effects of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1). Our results suggest that the helicase HAGE has a key role in the resistance of ABCB5+ MMICs to IFN\u03b1 treatment and that cancer therapies targeting HAGE may have broad implications for the treatment of malignant melanoma.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24525737","name":"The helicase HAGE prevents interferon-\u03b1-induced PML expression in ABCB5+ malignant melanoma-initiating cells by promoting the expression of SOCS1","publisher":"Cell Death and Disease","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAe4ATwBkzsAbwawvOaHGn1zV_nslIrqxrg,NAME_SEARCH,n-f9)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":7,"year":2014},"description":"Treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer remain limited and rarely curative. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is a prostate-specific protein overexpressed in 95% of prostate tumours. An FDA-approved vaccine for the treatment of advanced prostate disease, PROVENGE\u00ae (sipuleucel-T), has been shown to prolong survival, however the precise sequence of the PAP protein responsible for the outcome is unknown. As the PAP antigen is one of the very few prostate-specific antigens for which there is a rodent equivalent with high homology, preclinical studies using PAP have the potential to be directly relevant to clinical setting. Here, we show three PAP epitopes naturally processed and presented in the context of HHDII\/DR1 (114\u2013128, 299\u2013313, and 230\u2013244). The PAP-114-128 epitope elicits CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-specific responses in C57BL\/6 mice. Furthermore, when immunised in a DNA vector format (ImmunoBody\u00ae), PAP-114-128 prevents and reduces the growth of transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate-C1 prostate cancer cell-derived tumours in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. This anti-tumour effect is associated with infiltration of CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and the generation of high avidity T cells secreting elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3. PAP-114-128 therefore appears to be a highly relevant peptide on which to base vaccines for the treatment of prostate cancer.","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/eji.201343863\/abstract;jsessionid=E3F9CE6B46675069BE08161A83757221.f01t04","name":"Novel prostate acid phosphatase-based peptide vaccination strategy induces antigen-specific T-cell responses and limits tumour growth","publisher":"Wiley","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"}]},{"name":"Immunotherapeutic Targeting of Membrane Hsp70-Expressing Tumors Using Recombinant Human Granzyme B","description":"We have previously reported that human recombinant granzyme B (grB) mediates apoptosis in membrane heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-positive tumor cells in a perforin-independent manner.\n\nOptical imaging of uptake kinetics revealed co-localization of grB with recycling endosomes (Rab9\/11) as early as 5 min after internalization, with late endosomes (Rab7) after 30 min, and the lysosomal compartment (LAMP1\/2) after 60 to 120 min.

All patients in advanced tumor stages had significantly elevated Hsp70 levels in the circulation compared to a healthy control cohort and an early-stage tumor cohort, and Hsp70 levels progressively increased with higher UICC tumor stages. These findings demonstrate the potential of Hsp70 measurements to predict an advanced tumor stage in NSCLC patients. We have also demonstrated that the prevalence of CD3\u2212\/CD94+ NK cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were greater in advanced tumor stages, whereas that of CD4+ T helper cells was decreased. We hypothesize that raised levels of circulating Hsp70 in higher tumor stages might support NK cell proliferation, but that a lowered prevalence of CD4+ T helper cells could temper the capacity of cytolytic CD8+ T cells and NK cells to control tumor growth.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6694\/14\/22\/5701","name":"Elevated Levels of Circulating Hsp70 and an Increased Prevalence of CD94+\/CD69+ NK Cells Is Predictive for Advanced Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","publisher":"Cancers (Basel)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACX_jCIBBvqXFuLWfETHV_wanAmAnRAbZHk,NAME_SEARCH,jXZD)"}]},{"name":"SARS-Cov-2 Spike RBD and Nucleocapsid Encoding DNA Vaccine Elicits T cell and Neutralising Antibody Responses that Cross React with Variants","publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":2,"year":2023},"publisher":"Fortune Journals","url":"https:\/\/www.fortunejournals.com\/articles\/sarscov2-spike-rbd-and-nucleocapsid-encoding-dna-vaccine-elicits-t-cell-and-neutralising-antibody-responses-that-cross-react-with-.html","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABTSAV8BbAHnnv__vwtI1BjUaBZKKBoVv1k,NAME_SEARCH,TVVF)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABdxsNMBZLsEl98wH1mEgwS9dwiJNG3vQ5U,NAME_SEARCH,pgxR)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":6,"year":2023},"description":"Extracellular and membrane Hsp70 can serve as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic failure in early-stage tumors and as a target for the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in various tumor diseases.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/biomedicines11082276","name":"Hsp70 \u2013 A universal biomarker for predicting therapeutic failure in human female cancers and a target for CTC isolation in advanced cancers","publisher":"Biomedicines","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACX_jCIBBvqXFuLWfETHV_wanAmAnRAbZHk,NAME_SEARCH,jXZD)"}]},{"name":"Biomarkers in adult-type diffuse gliomas: Elevated levels of circulating vesicular Hsp70 serve as a biomarker in grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme and increase NK cell frequencies in grade 3 glioma","publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":7,"year":2023},"publisher":"Biomedicines, 11, 3235. doi: 10.3390\/biomedicines11123235","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2227-9059\/11\/12\/3235","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACX_jCIBBvqXFuLWfETHV_wanAmAnRAbZHk,NAME_SEARCH,jXZD)"}]},{"name":"Crosstalk Between NK Cell Receptors and Tumor MembraneHsp70-Derived Peptide: A Combined Computational andExperimental Study","publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":1,"year":2024},"publisher":"Advanced Science","url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/epdf\/10.1002\/advs.202305998","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQIr34BHPu93a1Y80a3FN1r5a65sze-CB4,NAME_SEARCH,B1NH)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACX_jCIBBvqXFuLWfETHV_wanAmAnRAbZHk,NAME_SEARCH,jXZD)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714150620000,"insightId":"4b8cd974-dbb5-4a41-b982-ca1042cddd70","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"description":"Presentation on Monday, April 29 th at 11:15 AM (London Time) BOSTON MA \/ ACCESSWIRE \/ April 26, 2024 \/ Radiance Biopharma (\"Radiance\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel Antibody Drug Conjugates...","fullText":"Presentation on Monday, April 29 th at 11:15 AM (London Time) BOSTON MA \/ ACCESSWIRE \/ April 26, 2024 \/ Radiance Biopharma (\"Radiance\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and Bispecific ADCs (BsADCs) treatments for cancers, today announced that Robert Brooks, JD, Chief Executive Officer of Radiance will present at the LSX World Congress 2024 on Monday, April 29, 2024 at 11:15AM (GMT+1) in London, England.
