The latter system which was synthesized via the ring opening polymerization of \u03b5-caprolactone, starting from a hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimer and characterized by means of 1H NMR, IR and DSC, was found to be compatible with both the polymer matrix and a hydrophilic chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOXO), the model drug used in this work. The preparation of the dendritic PCL star product with an average arm length of 2000 g\/mol was characterized using IR and 1H NMR measurements. The prepared star polymer possessed a higher crystallinity and a lower melting temperature than that of the used linear PCL. Electrospun fibers were prepared starting from solutions containing the neat PCL as well as the PCL\/PAMAM-PCL mixture. Electrospinning conditions were optimized in order to obtain defect free fibers, which was proven by the structural FE-SEM study. PAMAM moieties enhanced the hydrophilicity of the fibers, as proved by comparing the water absorption for the PCL\/PAMAM-PCL fibers to that neat PCL fibers.

Given their unique properties at the nanoscale, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn a great deal of interest due to their potential use in the biomedical field, targeting several applications such as heat hubs in magnetic hyperthermia (MHT, a heat-damage based therapy), contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery. Advances in the development of novel polymerization techniques has enabled the preparation of a large portfolio of polymers that have intriguing physicochemical properties; in particular, those polymers that can undergo conformational and structural changes in response to their surrounding environmental stimuli. Therefore, merging the unique features of MNPs with polymer responsive properties, such as pH and thermal stimuli activation, enables smart control of polymer properties operated by the MNPs and vice versa at an unprecedented level of sophistication. These magnetic-stimuli-responsive nanosystems will impact the cancer field by combining magnetic hyperthermia with stimuli-dependent controlled drug delivery toward multimodal therapies. In this Account, we have framed state of the art magnetic stimuli-responsive systems, focusing on thermo- and pH-responsive behavior, following an organization based on the response mechanisms of polymers. By evaluating the features of the most representative and advanced nanosystems that already exist in literature, we present the challenges to overcome, the future directions to undertake for the development of magnetic stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms that will work under clinical operating conditions and have biodegradable and biocompatible features, and a consideration of the technical aspects.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.accounts.7b00549","name":"Nanosystems Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles and Thermo- or pH-Responsive Polymers: An Update and Future Perspectives","publisher":"ACS Accounts of Chemical Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANv45MBAEXr_V7m_bmoJMl3WQth6aX79IE,NAME_SEARCH,loD1)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":9,"year":2019},"description":"The use of magnetic nanoparticles in oncothermia has been investigated for decades, but an effective combination of magnetic nanoparticles and localized chemotherapy under clinical magnetic hyperthermia (MH) conditions calls for novel platforms. In this study, we have engineered magnetic thermo-responsive iron oxide nanocubes (TR-cubes) to merge MH treatment with heat-mediated drug delivery having in mind the clinical translation of the nanoplatform. We have chosen iron-oxide based-nanoparticles with a cubic shape because of their outstanding heat performance under MH clinical conditions, which makes them benchmark agents for MH. Accomplishing a surface-initiated polymerization of strongly interactive nanoparticles like our iron-oxide nanocubes, however, remains the main challenge to overcome. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate the growth of a polymer shell on each nanocube by simply irradiating a copper-mediated polymerization with a ultraviolet light (UV) light, which both speeds up the polymerization and prevents nanocube aggregation. Moreover, we demonstrate herein that these TR-cubes can carry chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOXO-loaded-TR-cubes) without compromising their thermo-responsiveness both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo efficacy studies showed complete tumor suppression and the highest survival rate for animals that had been treated with DOXO-loaded-TR-cubes, only when they were exposed to MH. The bio-distribution of intravenously injected TR-cubes showed signs of renal clearance within one week, and complete clearance after five months.

To address this limitation, we describe a biodegradable nanoparticlebased \u201cpriming\u201d approach to enhance the cytotoxic efficacy of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived NK cells. We present poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanodepots (NDs) that co-encapsulate prostratin, a latency-reversing agent, and anti-CD25 (aCD25), a cell surface binding antibody, to enhance primary NK cell function against HIV and cancer. We utilize a nanoemulsion synthesis scheme to encapsulate both prostratin and aCD25 within the PLGA NDs (termed Pro-aCD25-NDs). Physicochemical characterization studies of the NDs demonstrated that our synthesis scheme resulted in stable and monodisperse Pro-aCD25- NDs. The NDs successfully released both active prostratin and anti-CD25, and with controllable release kinetics. When Pro-aCD25-NDs were administered in an in vitro model of latent HIV and acute T cell leukemia using J-Lat 10.6 cells, the NDs were observed to prime J-Lat cells resulting in significantly increased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity compared to free prostratin plus anti-CD25, and other controls.

This unique chain formation, along with the mild hyperthermia and intrinsic cobalt toxicity, leads to complete tumor regression and improved overall survival in an in vivo murine xenograft model, all under clinically approved AMF conditions. Numerical calculations identify magnetic anisotropy as the main Co\u2013Fe NCs\u2019 feature to generate such chain formations. This novel combination therapy can improve the effects of magnetic hyperthermia, inaugurating investigation of mechanical behaviors of nanoparticles under AMF, as a new avenue for cancer therapy.","url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.202003712","name":"Exploiting Unique Alignment of Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles, Mild Hyperthermia, and Controlled Intrinsic Cobalt Toxicity for Cancer Therapy","publisher":"Advanced Materials","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANv45MBAEXr_V7m_bmoJMl3WQth6aX79IE,NAME_SEARCH,loD1)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":10,"year":2021},"description":"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) comprising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immune \u2018checkpoints\u2019, such as CTLA-4 and the PD1\/PDL1 axis have dramatically improved clinical outcomes for patients with cancer. However, ICB by itself has failed to provide benefit in a wide range of solid tumors, where recurrence still occurs with high incidence. These poor response rates may be due to the therapeutic shortcomings of ICB; namely, a lack of cancer-specific cytotoxicity and ability to debulk tumors. To overcome these limitations, effective ICB therapy may require the combination with other complementary therapeutic platforms. Here, we propose that photothermal therapy (PTT) is an ideal therapeutic modality for combination with ICB because it can generate both tumor-specific cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. PTT elicits these specific effects because it is a localized thermal ablation technique that utilizes light-responsive nanoparticles activated by a wavelength-matched laser. While ICB immunotherapy alone improves cancer immunogenicity but does not generate robust antitumor cytotoxicity, nanoparticle-based PTT elicits targeted and controlled cytotoxicity but sub-optimal long-term immunogenicity. Thus, the two platforms offer complementary and potentially synergistic antitumor effects, which will be detailed in this review. We highlight three classes of nanoparticles used as agents of PTT (i.e., metallic inorganic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles and organic dyes), and illustrate the potential for nanoparticle-based PTT to potentiate the effects of ICB in preclinical models. Through this discussion, we aim to present PTT combined with ICB as a potent synergistic combination treatment for diverse cancer types currently refractory to ICB as well as PTT monotherapies.","url":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02656736.2020.1797190","name":"Photothermal therapies to improve immune checkpoint blockade for cancer","publisher":"International Journal of Hyperthermia","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANv45MBAEXr_V7m_bmoJMl3WQth6aX79IE,NAME_SEARCH,loD1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABAoPQIB9kwDlb7Q0cC00I7-j6uoR2jemz8,NAME_SEARCH,RP99)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADIlIRgBwBKjZo_PtBeyYr5L-fsB6wkbLd8,NAME_SEARCH,YvQo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAP5gXoBjnmz0PXMWoSP6m1m7tUWQPcYZmI,NAME_SEARCH,YZKf)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":23,"year":2021},"description":"Adoptive T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary immunotherapy for treating cancer.

An efficient therapy must act on low proliferating quiescent-CSCs (q-CSCs). We here investigate the effect of magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) in combination with local chemotherapy as a dual therapy to inhibit patient-derived colorectal qCR-CSCs. We apply iron oxide nanocubes as MHT heat mediators, coated with a thermoresponsive polymer (TR-Cubes) and loaded with DOXO (TR-DOXO) as a chemotherapeutic agent. The thermoresponsive polymer releases DOXO only at a temperature above 44 \u00b0C. In colony-forming assays, the cells exposed to TR-Cubes with MHT reveal that qCR-CSCs struggle to survive the heat damage and, with a due delay, restart the division of dormant cells. The eradication of qCR-CSCs with a complete stop of the colony formation was achieved only with TR-DOXO when exposed to MHT. The in vivo tumor formation study confirms the combined effects of MHT with heat-mediated drug release: only the group of animals that received the CR-CSCs pretreated, in vitro, with TR-DOXO and MHT lacked the formation of tumor even after several months. For DOXO-resistant CR-CSCs cells, the same results were shown, in vitro, when choosing the drug oxaliplatin rather than DOXO and applying MHT. These findings emphasize the potential of our nanoplatforms as an effective patient-personalized cancer treatment against qCR-CSCs.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.0c21349","name":"Magnetic Nanoparticle-Based Hyperthermia Mediates Drug Delivery and Impairs the Tumorigenic Capacity of Quiescent Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells","publisher":"ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANv45MBAEXr_V7m_bmoJMl3WQth6aX79IE,NAME_SEARCH,loD1)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":12,"year":2021},"description":"Despite the promise of immunotherapy such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 for advanced melanoma, only 26%\u201352% of patients respond, and many experience grade III\/IV immune-related adverse events. Motivated by the need for an effective therapy for patients non-responsive to clinically approved ICIs, we have developed a novel nanoimmunotherapy that combines locally administered Prussian blue nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy (PBNP-PTT) with systemically administered agonistic anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody therapy (aCD137). PBNP-PTT was administered at various thermal doses to melanoma cells in vitro, and was combined with aCD137 in vivo to test treatment effects on melanoma tumor progression, animal survival, immunological protection against tumor rechallenge, and hepatotoxicity. When administered at a melanoma-specific thermal dose, PBNP-PTT elicits immunogenic cell death (ICD) in melanoma cells and upregulates markers associated with antigen presentation and immune cell co-stimulation in vitro. Consequently, PBNP-PTT eliminates primary melanoma tumors in vivo, yielding long-term tumor-free survival. However, the antitumor immune effects generated by PBNP-PTT cannot eliminate secondary tumors, despite significantly slowing their growth. The addition of aCD137 enables significant abscopal efficacy and improvement of survival, functioning through activated dendritic cells and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and generates CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory that manifests in the rejection of tumor rechallenge, with no long-term hepatotoxicity.

Motivated by this need for targeted PTT agents for CNS tumors, we present a PBNP formulation that targets fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14)-expressing glioblastoma cell lines. We conjugated an antibody targeting Fn14, a receptor abundantly expressed on many glioblastomas but near absent on healthy CNS tissue, to PBNPs (aFn14-PBNPs). We measured the attachment efficiency of aFn14 onto PBNPs, the size and stability of aFn14-PBNPs, and the ability of aFn14-PBNPs to induce thermal and immunogenic cell death and target and treat glioblastoma tumor cells in vitro. aFn14 remained stably conjugated to the PBNPs for at least 21 days. Further, PTT with aFn14-PBNPs induced thermal and immunogenic cell death in glioblastoma tumor cells. However, in a targeted treatment assay, PTT was only effective in killing glioblastoma tumor cells when using aFn14-PBNPs, not when using PBNPs alone. Our methodology is novel in its targeting moiety, tumor application, and combination with PTT. To the best of our knowledge, PBNPs have not been investigated as a targeted PTT agent in glioblastoma via conjugation to aFn14.
