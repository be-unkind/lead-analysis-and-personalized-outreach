{"summary":"I am a chemical engineer with a proven ability to think and work across different fields. I thrive when I can see the connections between different science and engineering specialties, and communicate my ideas to a multi-disciplinary team. My work experience and education range from biotechnology, chemical engineering and biomedical engineering to quantitative systems pharmacology. While I have a broad background, my core technical competencies lie in numerical methods and algorithms design, in particular for sensitivity analysis, optimization, finite element computation and dynamical systems analysis. I enjoy the research and prototyping phases of a project, but I am equally accomplished at implementing, and getting a final product out into the world and to the customer.  It is extremely important to me to know how my projects contribute to the overall success of any organization for whom I work.","lastName":"Wilkins","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:12086534","geoRegion":"Greater Boston","fullName":"Katharina Wilkins","firstName":"Katharina","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Metrum Research

By encapsulating mechanistic detail of chemical and physical processes, mathematical models can successfully simulate and predict emergent network properties. However, methods are needed for analyzing the role played by individual biochemical steps in producing context-dependent system behavior, thereby linking individual molecular knowledge with network properties. Here, we apply sensitivity analysis to analyze mammalian circadian rhythms and find that a contiguous series of reactions in one of the four negative feedback loops carries primary responsibility for determining the intrinsic length of day. The key reactions, all involving the gene per2 and its products, include Per2 mRNA export and degradation, and PER2 phosphorylation, transcription, and translation. Interestingly, mutations affecting PER2 phosphorylation have previously been linked to circadian disorders. The method may be generally applicable to probe structure\u2013function relationships in biological networks.","url":"http:\/\/www.ploscompbiol.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030242","name":"The Per2 Negative Feedback Loop Sets the Period in the Mammalian Circadian Clock Mechanism","publisher":"PLoS Comput Biol","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAC4bQYB508zxVOL-Odj21E9ApRnEBE2vRA,NAME_SEARCH,Ph61)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAej0HgBB3CORaI_Xol7Ln9yO1TJSV010ZA,NAME_SEARCH,nU_b)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":25,"year":2009},"description":"Boundary value formulations are presented for exact and efficient sensitivity analysis, with respect to model parameters and initial conditions, of different classes of oscillating systems. Methods for the computation of sensitivities of derived quantities of oscillations such as period, amplitude, and different types of phases are first developed for limit-cycle oscillators. In particular, a novel decomposition of the state sensitivities into three parts is proposed to provide an intuitive classification of the influence of parameter changes on period, amplitude, and relative phase. The importance of the choice of time reference, i.e., the phase locking condition, is demonstrated and discussed, and its influence on the sensitivity solution is quantified. The methods are then extended to other classes of oscillatory systems in a general formulation. Numerical techniques are presented to facilitate the solution of the boundary value problem and the computation of different types of sensitivities. Numerical results are verified by demonstrating consistency with finite difference approximations and are superior both in computational efficiency and in numerical precision to existing partial methods.\n\n\nRead More: https:\/\/epubs.siam.org\/doi\/10.1137\/070707129","url":"https:\/\/epubs.siam.org\/doi\/10.1137\/070707129","name":"Sensitivity Analysis for Oscillating Dynamical Systems","publisher":"SIAM J.
