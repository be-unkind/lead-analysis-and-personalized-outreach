During this project, I was under the supervision of A\/P Praveen Linga as well as the able mentorship of Dr. Ponnivalavan Babu.\n\nThis project involved the conceptualization of a batch process to use binary gas hydrates for desalination under high pressure and low temperatures. Possible industrial applications include combining the hydrate formation process with carbon dioxide capture as well as natural gas storage.\n\nMy role in this project was to plan and design the experimental process reactor to optimize the hydrocarbon capture of gas hydrate formations. The conditions used approximated deep-sea temperature and pressure conditions where gas hydrates naturally form.  In addition, I also planned and conducted experimental runs with varying carbon dioxide gas mixtures to optimize hydrocarbon capture.","title":"Freeze Desalination with Binary Clathrate Hydrates (Final Year Research Project)","url":"http:\/\/gashydrates.chbe.nus.edu.sg\/","members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWynQ0BLABzmpn4uMUr3hTwUgQzY-8Kdys,NAME_SEARCH,8v8q)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUnN-8BXfaIf-m4YwfXSWB-4KQzlh-tRGo,NAME_SEARCH,jStW)"}],"startedOn":{"month":6,"year":2016}},{"endedOn":{"month":4,"year":2017},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWynQ0BLABzmpn4uMUr3hTwUgQzY-8Kdys,NAME_SEARCH,8v8q)"}],"description":"The project involves the ground up design of a methanol-to-olefin plant.
