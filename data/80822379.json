There are, however, technical challenges to the production of exact copies of such large molecules. In this study, we performed a head-to-head comparison between the originator anti-VEGF-A Fab product LUCENTIS\u00ae (ranibizumab) and an intended copy product using an integrated analytical approach. While no differences could be observed using size-exclusion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate and potency assays, different acidic peaks were identified with cation ion exchange chromatography and capillary zone electrophoresis. Further investigation of the intact Fab, subunits and primary sequence with mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of a modified light chain variant in the intended copy product batches. This variant was characterized with a mass increase of 27.01 Da compared to the originator sequence and its abundance was estimated in the range of 6\u20139% of the intended copy product light chain. MS\/MS spectra interrogation confirmed that this modification relates to a serine to asparagine sequence variant found in the intended copy product light chain. We demonstrated that the integration of high-resolution and sensitive orthogonal technologies was beneficial to assess the similarity of an originator and an intended copy product.","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/19420862.2017.1366395?scroll=top&needAccess=true","name":"Identification of multiple serine to asparagine sequence variation sites in an intended copy product of LUCENTIS\u00ae by mass spectrometry","publisher":"mAbs","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATRQGsBiYFa2KRl5BVdaI34JMcZj1tyWLA,NAME_SEARCH,IkNC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFrjkUBvYNcHPIyGyyr6S-_55z35AAXA9U,NAME_SEARCH,-BNX)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFklb0B8D-K5T9qaqjfr6t6WgTOFqvEBoo,NAME_SEARCH,Bpgr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHcdEsBcmiZ3bsJujXF8xMYeLiFyU_qpos,NAME_SEARCH,7ybh)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":12,"year":2019},"description":"Characterization and monitoring of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key analytical requirements during the development of biologics. Top and middle-down (MD) approaches aim at capturing a direct snapshot of all proteoforms with their combinatorial distribution. However, classical MD data analysis is predominantly limited to the interpretation of terminal ion series and PTMs matched by mass. In this study, time-resolved deconvolution (TRD) maps were produced to detect variants and impurities in Fd, Fc\/2, and LC subunits of an IgG1 consistently across multiple samples. Classical MD analysis retrieved terminal ions, suggesting a deamidation at a NN motif for a LC+1 Da species, and inconclusive information for a LC+40 Da species. Additionally, we performed differential analysis of all MS2 ions across unmodified and variant subunit spectra to focus data analysis on spectral differences and reveal diagnostic ions (present, absent, enriched, or depleted ions) before fragment assignment. This sensitive methodology was able to detect diagnostic ions in a chimeric spectrum pointing at a proline-to-histidine sequence variant (+40 Da) missed by classical MD analysis. This methodology was pivotal to unravel relevant terminal ions and internal fragments N-terminal to proline as diagnostic ions to confirm the deamidation site. Moreover, different cleavage propensities were revealed at the deamidated DN site compared to the native NN motif for terminal and internal fragments, which may be tracked as a diagnostic behavior. Differential analysis may refine the detection of novel diagnostic ions and leverage the sequence information on internal fragments for the characterization of product-related variants and impurities by MD mass spectrometry.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.8b05886","name":"All Ion Differential Analysis Refines the Detection of Terminal and Internal Diagnostic Fragment Ions for the Characterization of Biologics Product-Related Variants and Impurities by Middle-down Mass Spectrometry","publisher":"Analytical chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATRQGsBiYFa2KRl5BVdaI34JMcZj1tyWLA,NAME_SEARCH,IkNC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALoA5wB_QDtKuZ3-744K84BlNX4pMXGB-0,NAME_SEARCH,kv8Y)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFklb0B8D-K5T9qaqjfr6t6WgTOFqvEBoo,NAME_SEARCH,Bpgr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACErSj0BMB1C3XvfH7nyCENXKoQ-02aTEvw,NAME_SEARCH,war_)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHcdEsBcmiZ3bsJujXF8xMYeLiFyU_qpos,NAME_SEARCH,7ybh)"}]},{"name":"WO2021087050 - CRIZANLIZUMAB CONTAINING ANTIBODY FORMULATION","publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":6,"year":2021},"description":"Patent\n\nThe present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical formulations of an antibody against human P-selectin [...]","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATRQGsBiYFa2KRl5BVdaI34JMcZj1tyWLA,NAME_SEARCH,IkNC)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":15,"year":2022},"description":"In this study, we report the isomerization of an aspartic acid residue in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) of crizanlizumab as a major degradation pathway. The succinimide intermediate and iso-aspartic acid degradation products were successfully isolated by ion exchange chromatography for characterization. The isomerization site was identified at a DG motif in the CDR by peptide mapping. The biological characterization of the isolated variants showed that the succinimide variant exhibited a loss in target binding and biological activity compared to the aspartic acid and iso-aspartic acid variants of the molecule. The influence of pH on this isomerization reaction was investigated using capillary zone electrophoresis. Below pH 6.3, the succinimide formation was predominant, whereas at pH values above 6.3, iso-aspartic acid was formed and the initial amounts of succinimide dropped to levels even lower than those observed in the starting material. Importantly, while the succinimide accumulated at long-term storage conditions of 2 to 8\u00b0C at pH values below 6.3, a complete hydrolysis of succinimide was observed at physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37\u00b0C), resulting in full recovery of the biological activity. In this study, we demonstrate that the critical quality attribute succinimide with reduced potency has little or no impact on the efficacy of crizanlizumab due to the full recovery of the biological activity within a few hours under physiological conditions.","url":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/19420862.2022.2151075","name":"Restoring the biological activity of crizanlizumab at physiological conditions through a pH-dependent aspartic acid isomerization reaction","publisher":"mAbs","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATRQGsBiYFa2KRl5BVdaI34JMcZj1tyWLA,NAME_SEARCH,IkNC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA8DQpEBr0XlR4ccscrpHHG-ENQ7BKcdOzc,NAME_SEARCH,POmO)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAtVvagBKcbnX8Yw0UT8NqIi-2NHzvWayZc,NAME_SEARCH,SfdS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALoA5wB_QDtKuZ3-744K84BlNX4pMXGB-0,NAME_SEARCH,kv8Y)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAAUj2MB1w-a7o3ZYtGruHNCOSf0qv9Q3Z4,NAME_SEARCH,KsOD)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFklb0B8D-K5T9qaqjfr6t6WgTOFqvEBoo,NAME_SEARCH,Bpgr)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHcdEsBcmiZ3bsJujXF8xMYeLiFyU_qpos,NAME_SEARCH,7ybh)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715073840000,"insightId":"5bdb324e-bd4b-4eb7-b7af-de7bfc65e539","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFDtzPaRW4emg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1715073441849?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=ha8RVvWTm-e8Uq4TTYoFKB290o3RaayHpOx0fYLg52c","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFDtzPaRW4emg\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1715073441849?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=ha8RVvWTm-e8Uq4TTYoFKB290o3RaayHpOx0fYLg52c"}]},"description":"Preferred start date \/ 1st of July 2024 onwardsDuration: Initial contract up to two yearsYour responsibilities:Provide support to the development of therapeutic protein characterization methods by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry...","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.novartis.com\/careers\/career-search\/job\/details\/req-10005133-postgraduate-mass-spectrometry","title":"Postgraduate in Mass Spectrometry"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":77},{"type":"PRAISE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193541091147534339","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193541091147534339","reactionsCount":78,"commentsCount":3,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193541090728181760","message":{"attributes":[{"length":17,"start":50,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:massspectrometry"}}},{"length":24,"start":328,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eAhJfEXN"}}}],"text":"We are looking for a new talented postgraduate in #MassSpectrometry to join the highly innovative and collaborative Analytical Characterization team in Basel, Switzerland, to explore new Biologics characterization workflows.\n\nYou will find useful links towards the job description, minimum requirements, and application below:\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/eAhJfEXN"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7193541090728181760"}}},{"createdAt":1715077560000,"insightId":"e1157e6e-690f-4384-aff1-6853b02b32c9","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7191107122925830145,7193556829107306496)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7191107122925830145","reactionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Thank you for sharing the pictures and this update.
