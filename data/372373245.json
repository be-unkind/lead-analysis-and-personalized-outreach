resonance angiographic evaluation of the intracranial vasculature has been predominantly carried out using conventional angiographic techniques such as time of flight and phase contrast sequences. These techniques have good spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution. Newer faster angiographic techniques have been developed to circumvent this limitation. Elliptical centric time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (EC-TRICKS) is one such technique which has combined the use of elliptical centric ordering of the k-space with multiphase 3D digital subtraction MR angiogram (MRA) to achieve excellent temporal resolution of the arterial and venous circulations. Its applications have been mainly in the peripheral vasculature. We report the use of this technique in a case of a high-flow, direct carotid-cavernous fistula to demonstrate its potential in intracranial MR angiography.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17442526","name":"Magnetic resonance angiographic demonstration of carotid-cavernous fistula using elliptical centric time resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (EC-TRICKS)","publisher":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYx9v0Ba3n_w623mIXMcy7BWi8exnXgas4,NAME_SEARCH,7bmG)"}]},{"name":"Safety guidelines for MRI sites in Kuwait","publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":3,"year":2006},"description":"MRI safety Guidelines established for various MRI sites in Kuwait.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYx9v0Ba3n_w623mIXMcy7BWi8exnXgas4,NAME_SEARCH,7bmG)"}]},{"name":"\u2022\tFunctional MRI study of eating behavior and brain activation based on hunger conditions, age, gender and body mass index during and after the month of Ramadan.(","publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":1,"year":2007},"description":"Research Conducted with B Sc Radiology students from Kuwait University","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYx9v0Ba3n_w623mIXMcy7BWi8exnXgas4,NAME_SEARCH,7bmG)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":28,"year":2015},"description":"Previous and more recent work of analyzing structural changes in the brain suggest that certain brain regions such as the frontal lobe are among the brain regions profoundly affected by the aging process across males and females.
