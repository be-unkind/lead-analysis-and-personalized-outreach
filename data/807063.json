His family wanted hospice but an inpatient hospice bed wasn't available.\n\nOur palliative team planned to provide end-of-life care to him from his hospital bed. We ordered medicines to prevent & treat pain, fever, anxiety, excess secretions, and nausea. \n\nOne day I went to see him and he was sweating profusely, his skin was burning up and he was writhing and grabbing the bedsheets. He wasn't able to tell me how he felt, but I could see that he was suffering.\n\nI went to find his nurse.\n\nIt turned out that his around-the-clock Tylenol had been discontinued \"since he's dying,\" and his morphine had been discontinued because his blood pressure was dropping. In fact, the nurse refused to take my order to restart his morphine, and thus treat his pain, because she believed that it was unsafe to do so. \n\nI do not blame this nurse.\n\nEnd-of-life care is different than standard hospital care.\n\nThis nurse had been trained as a floor nurse, and in that context stopping morphine if a patient's blood pressure is too low is the right thing to do. The problem was, this patient's blood pressure was low because he was dying. Our goal for this man should have been to make his passage off this Earth as free of suffering as possible. \n\nStopping his morphine as he was dying increased his suffering. A lot. It was 100% the wrong thing to do.\n\nEveryone deserves to be comfortable as they transition to whatever is after this life. This means that everyone in healthcare should learn the skills required to care for people well at the end of their life.\n\nI'm doing my part by recording weekly episodes of The Integrative Palliative Podcast. Come listen and let me know which other topics you'd like me to cover.\n\nIf you teach nurses or doctors, be sure that they really learn about end-of-life care. A day of shadowing a hospice nurse is not sufficient. \n\nIt burns me up when end-of-life care is treated as less important care. As if a person who doesn't have a long life ahead of them is somehow less valuable.\n\nEvery person on this Earth is valuable. It is not the length of our life that gives us worth. It certainly isn't the number of letters after our name or the fullness of our bank account. It isn't even how nice or caring or giving we are.\n\nWe are valuable, and worthy of care, simply because we are. And every one of us deserves fully skilled and empathetic care until our body is permanently stilled.\n\n#endoflife #palliative #deathcare #hospice #palliativecare #EOL #meded #integrativepalliative\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7178195658854535169"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7178343229283598336"}}},{"createdAt":1716726120000,"insightId":"72ce927f-e8fd-48e3-82ed-844d6f19cccb","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7200386659488550912,7200471467573039104)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7200386659488550912","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations and wish you much success ahead."},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7200386659488550912"}}},{"createdAt":1715993940000,"insightId":"d50d78b3-8a29-4b03-b27a-b67e355ea4e6","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7196776559934873601,7197400274196467713)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7196776559934873601","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congrats Vincent"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7196776559934873601"}}},{"createdAt":1714824960000,"insightId":"1db83fd1-9229-49ba-8fae-4fa348cee67e","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7192396013297360896,7192497214538047488)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192396013297360896","reactionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations to Team PRPCS and Team Niloufer Hospital for Women & Children... \ud83d\ude4f"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7192396013297360896"}}},{"createdAt":1714047840000,"insightId":"ccd51ae7-14de-4155-b093-326f87911334","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7188883893138219008,7189237857004224513)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7188883893138219008","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congratulations on a journey well travelled.
