{"summary":"David is an old-school systems' engineer, enjoying the challenges of meshing the diverse disciplines of science and engineering.  He started into Lab Automation at Applied Biosystems, leading architecture for a new oligonucleotide manufacturing plant. He moved from California to Milan, to join a drug discovery CRO, Axxam SpA, to create compound storage and management systems for high-throughput screening. He then moved back to the US to coordinate organizations of scientists and engineers to build a fully-integrated platforms with applications across genetic screening with Counsyl, mass-production of CRISPR RNA with Synthego, and liquid biopsy with GRAIL - the most recent role helping detect cancer at population-scale.\n\nHe has a Master in Physics at Cambridge University in the UK, a Masters in Instrumentation Systems, and a PhD in Medical Physics, creating novel instrumentation to detect breast cancer, both from University College London.\n\nGeneral\n\u2022\t20+ years\u2019 experience in Process \/ Systems Engineering, creating solutions with components and teams from various disciplines (mechanical, electronic, software, biology, chemistry) \u2013 15+ in Lab Automation\n\u2022\t15+ years of technical leadership with 10+ years of management (departments of up to 30, including senior managers and individual contributors), in a variety of regulated environments (CLIA, ISO 13485, GMP)\n\u2022\t20+ years facilitation for interpersonal-\/soft-skills training; certified Myers-Briggs practitioner\n\nTechnical\n\u2022\tDeep knowledge of automation (inc liquid handling) for biotech manufacturing or sample processing (NGS)\n\u2022\tExperienced process engineer, streamlining workflows for maximum efficiency and capex utilisation\n\u2022\tDriven numerous data management solutions for automated production lines (LIMS \/ MES)\n\u2022\tCreated full suites of characterisation studies (DoE), analytics, and validation studies for tech transfer \n\u2022\tResponsible for proposal and execution for $100m+ capital expenditures","pastPositions":[{"endedOn":{"month":7,"year":2003},"companyName":"ADC Theatre, University of Cambridge","title":"Freelance technical staff","companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:2773671","posId":1,"current":true,"startedOn":{"month":12,"year":1999}}],"lastName":"Jennions","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:16957919","geoRegion":"Raleigh, North Carolina, United States","fullName":"David Jennions","firstName":"David","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"GRAIL","description":"Created, hired, and manage all local R&D staff including automation engineers, tech\/design transfer process engineers, and assay implementation scientists, with an aim to bridge the roles between main R&D team (in the SF Bay Area) and the RTP operations teams (in North Carolina).
