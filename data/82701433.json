The demonstration of force activation, identification of consequent downstream events in live cells, and development of tools to study these dynamic processes in living cells are central to elucidating the role of \u03b1-catenin in cellular mechanics and tissue function. Here we demonstrate that \u03b1-catenin is a force-activatable mechanotransducer at cell-cell junctions by using an engineered \u03b1-catenin conformation sensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). This sensor reconstitutes \u03b1-catenin-dependent functions in \u03b1-catenin-depleted cells and recapitulates the behavior of the endogenous protein. Dynamic imaging of cells expressing the sensor demonstrated that \u03b1-catenin undergoes immediate, reversible conformation switching in direct response to different mechanical perturbations of cadherin adhesions. Combined magnetic twisting cytometry with dynamic FRET imaging revealed rapid, local conformation switching upon the mechanical stimulation of specific cadherin bonds. At acutely stretched cell-cell junctions, the immediate, reversible conformation change further reveals that \u03b1-catenin behaves like an elastic spring in series with cadherin and actin. The force-dependent recruitment of vinculin\u2014a principal \u03b1-catenin effector\u2014to junctions requires the vinculin binding site of the \u03b1-catenin sensor. In cells, the relative rates of force-dependent \u03b1-catenin conformation switching and vinculin recruitment reveal that \u03b1-catenin activation and vinculin recruitment occur sequentially, rather than in a concerted process, with vinculin accumulation being significantly slower. This engineered \u03b1-catenin sensor revealed that \u03b1-catenin is a reversible, stretch-activatable sensor that mechanically links cadherin complexes and actin and is an indispensable player in cadherin-specific mechanotransduction at intercellular junctions.","url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/current-biology\/pdfExtended\/S0960-9822%2814%2901444-4","name":"Dynamic Visualization of \u03b1-Catenin Reveals Rapid, Reversible Conformation Switching between Tension States","publisher":"Current Biology\/Cell Press","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASU7jMBoiYZQJJyeZH7mEpsyhVnAziycS8,NAME_SEARCH,YOL_)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATt7HkBQ3IopEE0mZIXIm7i_LLcyj5ZZH8,NAME_SEARCH,iA8c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHBqOgB4jfl2KghxSl8NAA4yf5LXK_KrLQ,NAME_SEARCH,a-k7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":15,"year":2014},"description":"These findings demonstrate the role of alpha-catenin in cadherin-based adhesion and mechanotransduction, in different mechanical contexts.

Previous studies have variously implicated actomyosin-generated pushing or pulling forces on the nucleus as well as pulling by nucleus-bound microtubule motors. We found that the nucleus in an isolated migrating cell can move forward without any trailing edge detachment. When a new lamellipodium was triggered with photoactivation of Rac1, the nucleus moved toward the new lamellipodium. This forward motion required both nuclear-cytoskeletal linkages and myosin activity. Apical or basal actomyosin bundles were found not to translate with the nucleus. Although microtubules dampen fluctuations in nuclear position, they are not required for forward translocation of the nucleus during cell migration. Trailing edge detachment and pulling with a microneedle produced motion and deformation of the nucleus suggestive of a mechanical coupling between the nucleus and the trailing edge. Significantly, decoupling the nucleus from the cytoskeleton with KASH over-expression greatly decreased the frequency of trailing edge detachment. Collectively, these results explain how the nucleus is moved in a crawling fibroblast and raise the possibility that forces could be transmitted from the front to the back of the cell through the nucleus.","url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/biophysj\/abstract\/S0006-3495(13)05749-4","name":"Actomyosin Pulls to Advance the Nucleus in a Migrating Tissue Cell","publisher":"Biophysical Journal\/Cell Press","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATt7HkBQ3IopEE0mZIXIm7i_LLcyj5ZZH8,NAME_SEARCH,iA8c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGI2ewBn6wYTiQS8U47hVJZ425QvsWjTsQ,NAME_SEARCH,-aa8)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAY_yv8BIbn3qgN9NG2Fscon0F-9VLw-gTw,NAME_SEARCH,a5Fk)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALrL0EB_SXgsOVtaviFWBA-quXHFkxZ8Rc,NAME_SEARCH,efWo)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"year":2013},"description":"Despite their rigidity, microtubules in living cells bend significantly during polymerization resulting in greater curvature than can be explained by thermal forces alone.

Surprisingly, regions near newly created minus ends increased in curvature following severing, whereas regions near new microtubule plus ends depolymerized without any observable change in shape. With dynein inhibited, regions near severed minus ends straightened rapidly following severing. These observations suggest that dynein exerts a pulling force on the microtubule that buckles the newly created minus end. Moreover, the lack of any observable straightening suggests that dynein prevents lateral motion of microtubules. To explain these results, we developed a model for intracellular microtubule mechanics that predicts the enhanced buckling at the minus end of a severed microtubule. Our results show that microtubule shapes reflect a dynamic force balance in which dynein motor and friction forces dominate elastic forces arising from bending moments. A centrosomal array of microtubules subjected to dynein pulling forces and resisted by dynein friction is predicted to center on the experimentally observed time scale, with or without the pushing forces derived from microtubule buckling at the cell periphery.","url":"http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/22\/24\/4834.abstract","name":"Effects of dynein on microtubule mechanics and centrosome positioning","publisher":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATt7HkBQ3IopEE0mZIXIm7i_LLcyj5ZZH8,NAME_SEARCH,iA8c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAcb3o0BY-rxUEsQwPMUKPqj1VyTKhR3BCw,NAME_SEARCH,Iz9q)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADTZrUBW2RiCDbV7hwhhQmmHbF9p3IoVY0,NAME_SEARCH,glW_)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAALrL0EB_SXgsOVtaviFWBA-quXHFkxZ8Rc,NAME_SEARCH,efWo)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":1,"year":2011},"description":"In living cells, a fluctuating torque is exerted on the nuclear surface but the origin of the torque is unclear. In this study, we found that the nuclear rotation angle is directionally persistent on a time scale of tens of minutes, but rotationally diffusive on longer time scales. Rotation required the activity of the microtubule motor dynein. We formulated a model based on microtubules undergoing dynamic instability, with tensional forces between a stationary centrosome and the nuclear surface mediated by dynein. Model simulations suggest that the persistence in rotation angle is due to the transient asymmetric configuration of microtubules exerting a net torque in one direction until the configuration is again randomized by dynamic instability. The model predicts that the rotational magnitude must depend on the distance between the nucleus and the centrosome. To test this prediction, rotation was quantified in patterned cells in which the cell's centrosome was close to the projected nuclear centroid. Consistent with the prediction, the angular displacement was found to decrease in these cells relative to unpatterned cells.

These results build on previous findings, which demonstrated that mechanically perturbed E-Cadherin receptors activate phosphoinositide-3-kinase and downstream integrins, in an EGFR-dependent manner. Results of this study show that this EGFR-mediated kinase cascade controls the force-dependent recruitment of vinculin to stressed E-Cadherin complexes--a key early signature of cadherin-based mechanotransduction. Vinculin targeting requires phosphorylation at tyrosine 822 by Abelson family kinase (Abl), but the origin of force-dependent Abl activation had not been identified. We now present evidence that integrin activation, which is downstream from EGFR signaling controls Abl activation, thus linking E-Cadherin to Abl through a mechanosensitive signaling network. These findings place EGFR and integrins at the center of a positive feedback loop, through which force-activated E-Cadherin signals regulate vinculin recruitment to cadherin complexes, in response to increased intercellular tension.","url":"http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/content\/early\/2018\/02\/14\/jcs.206656","name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor and integrins control force-dependent vinculin recruitment to E-Cadherin junctions","publisher":"Journal of Cell Science \/ The Company of Biologists","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATt7HkBQ3IopEE0mZIXIm7i_LLcyj5ZZH8,NAME_SEARCH,iA8c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA0GSbEBYND5dAqKaxXNCq6QjFyh8RfY-xg,NAME_SEARCH,vciz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHBqOgB4jfl2KghxSl8NAA4yf5LXK_KrLQ,NAME_SEARCH,a-k7)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":4,"year":2021},"description":"The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global public health and economy unprecedentedly, requiring accelerating development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961. Moreover, we further tested the antiviral efficiency of PR1077 in the Ad5-hACE2 transduction mouse model of COVID-19. A single injection provided potent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in either prophylactic or treatment groups. Taken together, these results shed light on the development of mAb-related therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.","url":"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pbio.3001209","name":"Structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with novel binding epitopes","publisher":"PLOS Biology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAATt7HkBQ3IopEE0mZIXIm7i_LLcyj5ZZH8,NAME_SEARCH,iA8c)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714962300000,"insightId":"c6c65aa9-99e2-4adf-8c82-89e337c41690","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193073358169600000","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193073358169600000","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193073357733437440","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Go Gators \ud83d\udc0a "},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQG30s_1_j6HFw\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714425663917?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=Iz-n8QwOylzDJRIxh-AReM44wS_mnH-xOFTI4ShNSF4","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQG30s_1_j6HFw\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1714425663917?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=Iz-n8QwOylzDJRIxh-AReM44wS_mnH-xOFTI4ShNSF4"}]},"description":"The University of Florida has been recognized by Forbes as one of 10 public \u201cNew Ivies\u201d for producing exceptional and highly employable graduates.
