This label-free approach does not require any specific reagents to confirm the depletion of RNAi target protein(s) in unfractionated cell or whole organism extracts. The protocol described here is general, can be developed rapidly, and can be multiplexed to detect and measure multiple proteins at once. Furthermore, the methodology can be extended to any tandem mass spectrometer, making it widely accessible. This methodology will be applicable to a wide range of basic science and clinical questions where RNAi-mediated protein depletion needs to be verified, or where differences in relative abundance of target proteins need to be rapidly assessed between samples.","publisher":"Journal of Proteome Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFdAxABOnF8mpqN1wRMj2Slizt-nYNQdus,NAME_SEARCH,LiHB)"}]},{"name":"Skyline: an open source document editor for creating and analyzing targeted proteomics experiments","publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":9,"year":2010},"publisher":"Bioinformatics","url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/26\/7\/966.abstract?keytype=ref&%2520ijkey=s3us5ZizWIsCxZo","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFdAxABOnF8mpqN1wRMj2Slizt-nYNQdus,NAME_SEARCH,LiHB)"}]},{"name":"Automated DBS microsampling, microscale automation and microflow LC\u2013MS for therapeutic protein PK","publishedOn":{"month":3,"year":2016},"publisher":"Bioanalysis","url":"http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.4155\/bio-2015-0006","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFdAxABOnF8mpqN1wRMj2Slizt-nYNQdus,NAME_SEARCH,LiHB)"}]},{"name":"The development of selected reaction monitoring methods for targeted proteomics via empirical refinement","publishedOn":{"month":4,"year":2012},"description":"Software advancements in the last several years have had a significant impact on proteomics from method development to data analysis. Herein, we detail a method, which uses our in-house developed software tool termed Skyline, for empirical refinement of candidate peptides from targeted proteins. The method consists of four main steps from generation of a testable hypothesis, method development, peptide refinement, to peptide validation. The ultimate goal is to identify the best performing peptide in terms of ionization efficiency, reproducibility, specificity, and chromatographic characteristics to monitor as a proxy for protein abundance. It is important to emphasize that this method allows the user to perform this refinement procedure in the sample matrix and organism of interest with the instrumentation available. Finally, the method is demonstrated in a case study to determine the best peptide to monitor the abundance of surfactant protein B in lung aspirates.","publisher":"Proteomics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFdAxABOnF8mpqN1wRMj2Slizt-nYNQdus,NAME_SEARCH,LiHB)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbq7rcBnka7YaSZs0LeCsmqlYbgvVadzOE,NAME_SEARCH,Go3L)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIuqOEB3u23ufzJtWROHjqAx-1Jr3_641s,NAME_SEARCH,oNTp)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEsioUBNizrenxJOUMWmDYnELbKRzvA9kw,NAME_SEARCH,tvtV)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABDT_o0BjRT5PwQIVZUprkJUCaVy9PN02I8,NAME_SEARCH,KMk6)"}]},{"name":"Expediting the Development of Targeted SRM Assays: Using Data from Shotgun Proteomics to Automate Method Development","publishedOn":{"month":3,"year":2009},"publisher":"Journal of Proteome Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAFdAxABOnF8mpqN1wRMj2Slizt-nYNQdus,NAME_SEARCH,LiHB)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAA0J5kBitX8jp8qpjdCWJfED7cMvSvGMEU,NAME_SEARCH,k4Br)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADuLNcB3hIZ0mqbivTEQj70Y-4b5dlHzVs,NAME_SEARCH,C9Xt)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIuqOEB3u23ufzJtWROHjqAx-1Jr3_641s,NAME_SEARCH,oNTp)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJD15cBaG1YEJmNIXu7dmEj2IOOPqnvs3E,NAME_SEARCH,rThj)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEsioUBNizrenxJOUMWmDYnELbKRzvA9kw,NAME_SEARCH,tvtV)"}]},{"name":"A method to determine the kinetics of multiple proteins in human infants with respiratory distress syndrome","publishedOn":{"month":4,"year":2012},"description":"We report a method to measure in vivo turnover of four proteins from sequential tracheal aspirates obtained from human newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome using targeted proteomics.
