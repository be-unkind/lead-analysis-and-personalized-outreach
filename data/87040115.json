The primary effect of this drug is to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin release from pancreatic islet-\u03b2-cells by induction of a decrease in potassium efflux from these cells. Because of the poor aqueous solubility, its absorption is limited. Thus, an attempt was made to improve its release profile.\n\nMethods: The hollow drug-loaded alginate beads in combination with low methoxyl pectin and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) were prepared by a simple ionotropic gelation method. The beads were evaluated for particle size and morphology using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Mucoadhesion test was done using goat stomach mucosal membrane. Release characteristics of the gliclazide-loaded hollow beads were studied in 0.1\u2009N HCl (pH 1.2) and phosphate buffer (pH 5.8).\n\nResults: The developed beads were spherical in shape with hollow internal structure and had a particle size in the range of 0.730\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 to 0.890\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009mm. The incorporation efficiency of alginate -pectin beads was higher than alginate -HPMC beads. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction analysis showed stable character of drug in the drug-loaded hollow beads and revealed the absence of any drug -polymer interactions. The beads remained buoyant for more than 12\u2009h. The drug release from beads followed Fickian diffusion with swelling.\n\nConclusion: The preliminary results of this study suggest that the developed beads containing gliclazide could enhance drug entrapment efficiency, reduce the initial burst release and modulate the drug release.","url":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/03639045.2013.763817","name":"Development of novel gastroretentive drug delivery system of gliclazide: Hollow beads","publisher":"Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAARijAcBFnZyAgwabotP489sO3ddOAdx2MQ,NAME_SEARCH,84l6)"}]},{"name":"Preparation, characterization and evaluation of ranitidine hydrochloride loaded mucoadhesive microspheres for controlled drug delivery","publishedOn":{"year":2014},"publisher":"Polimery w Medycynie","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":2,"year":2014},"description":"The purpose of this study was to prepare and characterize levocetirizine hydrochloride loaded liposome of by film hydration technique followed by sonication.

Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis are the main autoimmune inflammatory bowel diseases. Metronidazole is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug indicates that the largest amount of the drug is absorbed from the upper part of the intestines and very little concentration of the drugs reaches the colon. Objectives. The aim of this investigation was to formulate metronidazole loaded microspheres for the efficient therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases. Material and Methods. Microspheres were prepared using the emulsification-solvent evaporation method. The effect of Eudragit S100 concentration and the ratio of liquid paraffin (light: heavy) on percentage yield, particle size, morphology, drug encapsulation and in vitro drug release was examined. Drug-polymer interaction was investigated using Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Results. The results showed that the particle had good flow properties, encapsulation efficiency (56.11 \u00b1 1.51\u201381.02 \u00b1 2.14%) and cumulative drug release (64.14 \u00b1 0.83\u201379.69 \u00b1 2.45%) in a phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) after 10 h of the dissolution study. An increased particle size was observed with an increasing polymer concentration. It was observed that the Eudragit had a positive effect on the drug encapsulation and negative effect on drug release. Aggregation of drug-polymer droplets was observed at a lower level of magnesium stearate during microsphere preparation. The results of FTIR spectroscopy revealed the absence of any drug-polymer interactions. However, slight peak shifting and suppression in peak height was observed.

Biologically, Saffron belongs to the carotenoid family with major active components such as crocin, safranal, and crocetin. Saffron has widely been used for traditional and herbal medicine. Clinically, Saffron has shown both safety and efficacy in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Saffron has the neuroprotective activity because of its chemical active moieties. Saffron's efficacy has been examined in some brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, and depression because of its chemically active moieties. In this chapter, we have explored the pharmacological insight of saffron for its benefits in brain-related diseases. It has been proposed that Saffron and its actives have the modulatory action on acetylcholinesterase activity, dopaminergic signaling, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), free radical scavenging activity, microglial activation, mitochondrial function, notch signaling pathway, Keap1\/Nrf2 signaling pathway, nuclear dactor-\u03baB activation, mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling, and A\u03b2. On other hand, Saffron has shown to counteract altered behavioral parameters such as learning and memory, motor function, and seizures in experimental brain diseases. It may be proposed possibly that saffron can serve as therapeutic herbal medicine for various brain-related conditions in humans. The exact mechanisms for the neuroprotection are not explicitly known.

The purpose of this work was to formulate ketoconazole loaded nanostructured lipid carriers formulation for skin targeting to minimize the adverse side effects and to prolong release.\n\nMethods: The ketoconazole loaded nanostructured lipid carriers were optimized using 32 factorial design to evaluate the effects of process and formulation variables. The nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared by melt-dispersion ultra-sonication method. The formulations were finally incorporated into polymeric gels of Carbopol 940 for convenient application. The gels were evaluated comparatively with commercially available formulations of ketoconazole with respect to ex vivo skin permeation and deposition study on human cadaver skin.\n\nResults: Nanostructured lipid carriers showed average particle size, zeta potential, and percentage entrapment in the range of 125.8 \u00b1 1.8 to 295.0 \u00b1 3.8 nm, -13.2 \u00b1 1.1 to -30.9 \u00b1 2.2 mV, and 69.47 \u00b1 2.8 to 95.49 \u00b1 4.5, respectively.

Morris water maze (MWM) and attentional set shifting tests (ASST) were used to assess the spatial learning, memory, reversal learning, and executive functioning in animals. Body weight, serum glucose, serum nitrite\/nitrate, vascular endothelial function, aortic superoxide anion, brains\u2019 oxidative markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive species-TBARS, reduced glutathione-GSH, superoxide dismutase-SOD, and catalase-CAT), inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and myeloperoxidase-MPO), acetylcholinesterase activity-AChE, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and histopathological changes were also assessed. UTI (10,000 U kg-1) and SUL (25mgkg-1) were used alone as well as in combination, as the treatment drugs. Donepezil (0.5mgkg-1) was used as a positive control.\nResults: STZ-administered rats showed reduction in body weight, learning, memory, reversal learning, executive functioning, impairment in endothelial function, BBB permeability, increase in serum glucose, brains\u2019 oxidative stress, inflammation, AChE-activity, BBB permeability and histopathological changes. Administration of UTI and SUL alone as well as in combination, significantly and dose dependently attenuated the STZ-diabetes-induced impairments in the behavioral, endothelial, and biochemical parameters.\nConclusion: STZ administration caused diabetes and VaD which was attenuated by the administration of UTI and SUL.

Success in achieving pulmonary delivery, requires overcoming barriers including mucociliary clearance and uptake by macrophages. An effective drug delivery system delivers the therapeutically active moieties at the right time and rate to target sites. A major limitation associated with most of the currently available conventional and controlled release drug delivery devices is that not all the drug candidates are well absorbed uniformly locally or systemically. Methods: We searched and reviewed the literature focusing on chitosan and chitosan derivative based nanocarrier systems used in pulmonary drug delivery. We focused on the applications of chitosan in the development of nanoparticles for this purpose. Results: Chitosan, a natural linear bio-polyaminosaccharide is central in the development of novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) including nanoparticles for use in the treatment of various respiratory diseases. It achieves this through its unique properties of biodegradability, biocompatibility, mucoadhesivity and its ability to enhance macromolecule permeation across membranes. It also achieves sustained and targeted effects, primary requirements for an effective pulmonary drug delivery system. This review highlights the applications and importance of chitosan with special emphasis on nanotechnology, employed in the management of respiratory diseases such as asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis.

Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug to which most Gram-negative and many Gram-positive bacteria are highly susceptible. Fluoroquinolones are administered repeatedly, twice a day for 5 days, during the course of therapy. Hence, they require repeated administration. Ciprofloxacin qualifies as a drug candidate for a controlled-release drug delivery system.\nObjectives. The present work was aimed to develop ciprofloxacin hydrochloride-containing matrix tablets by the wet granulation method.\nMaterial and Methods. The tablets were prepared using EthocelTM 100 Premium and Eudragit\u00ae RS PO (Evonik Laboratory, Mumbai, India) as a rate-controlling polymer. Granular dioctyl phthalate (DCP) was used as a diluent. An isopropyl alcohol and dichloromethane (1:1) mixture was used as a granulating agent. The effect of the formulation variables on tablet performance was examined based on weight variation, hardness, friability, thickness, and drug release profiles. The results suggested that the tablets had good integrity.\nResults. The tablets were stable for 18 months. Formulation F7 gave a linear release pattern up to 12 h. The release of ciprofloxacin from formulation F7 followed zero-order kinetics. The release mechanism was found to be diffusion-controlled as the Higuchi equation was obeyed.\nConclusion.

Nevirapine, an antiviral drug, is a potent reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). It is used in combination with nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV type-1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS. Nevirapine is a BCS class II drug which shows dissolution rate limited absorption.\nObjectives. The aim of the present research was to provide a fast dissolving solid dispersion of nevirapine.\nMaterial and Methods. The solubility of nevirapine was initially determined individually in four hydrotropic agents \u2013 namely urea, lactose, citric acid and mannitol \u2013 at a concentration of 10, 20, 30 and 40% w\/v solutions using purified water as a solvent. The highest solubility was obtained in the 40% citric acid solution. Then different combinations of 2 and 3 hydrotropic agents in different ratios were used to determine solubility, so that the total concentration of hydrotropic agents was always 40%.\nResults. The highest solubility was obtained in a solution of lactose and citric acid at the optimum ratio of 15:25. This optimized combination was utilized in preparing solid dispersions by a common solvent technique using distilled water as a solvent. The solid dispersions were evaluated for XRD, DSC and FTIR to show no drug-hydrotrope interaction.\nConclusion. It was concluded that the concept of mixed hydrotropic solid dispersion is a safe, novel and cost-effective technique for enhancing the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by dissolving the drug in a nonionized form. The enhancement in solubility of nevirapine using hydrotropy is a clear indication of its potential to be used in the future for other poorly water-soluble drugs in which low bioavailability is a major concern.","url":"https:\/\/www.polimery.umed.wroc.pl\/pl\/article\/2017\/47\/2\/83\/","name":"Improving the solubility of nevirapine using A hydrotropy and mixed hydrotropy based solid dispersion approach","publisher":"Polimery w Medycynie","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWqq3wB3i7K6-3oKPgrtNYJTM33BU-36mQ,NAME_SEARCH,hRE8)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2017},"description":"The present study aimed to develop matrix-type transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) of metoprolol tartrate using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).

Urinary tract infections caused by some gram positive and gram negative bacteria further enhance the chance of formation of such stones. Oxalis corniculata Linn. is an edible plant, traditionally used in the treatment of bacterial infections and kidney stones. However, there is no scientific evidence to relate the use of O. corniculata against struvite kidney stones. Hence, the antibacterial and struvite stones inhibition activity of the aqueous extract of Oxalis corniculata Linn. leaves and its biofabricated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was studied.\n\nMethods: The aqueous extract of O. corniculata was prepared by Soxhlet extraction. AgNPs were synthesized using green technique and were characterized using UV and IR spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, DLS and zeta potential studies. Antibacterial activity of the aqueous extract and the silver nanoparticles was tested against E. coli (gram negative) and S. aureus (gram positive) species. Struvite stones were grown in a gel medium by in vitro single diffusion gel growth technique and its inhibition study was carried out using the extract and its biofabricated nanoparticles.\n\nResults: The aqueous extract and its biofabricated AgNPs exhibited potent antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative strains of bacteria. The aqueous extract also effectively repressed the growth of struvite stones and led to the dissolution of stones, but the inhibitory effect was further enhanced by its biofabricated AgNPs.","url":"https:\/\/www.eurekaselect.com\/164000\/article","name":"Antibacterial and in vitro growth inhibition study of struvite urinary stones using Oxalis corniculata Linn. leaf extract and its biofabricated silver nanoparticles","publisher":"Recent Advances in Drug Delivery and Formulation","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABPvJxgB20NraPdoJ--U8ah_nPRZdmZlF7U,NAME_SEARCH,6P90)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWqq3wB3i7K6-3oKPgrtNYJTM33BU-36mQ,NAME_SEARCH,hRE8)"}]},{"name":"Controlled Release and Gastroretentive Drug Systems","publishedOn":{"year":2018},"publisher":"Oral Modified Release Drug Delivery Systems","url":"http:\/\/www.bspublications.net\/downloads\/05a7186887a289_Ch-1_Oral%20Modified%20Release%20Drug%20Delivery%20System_Piush%20Khare.pdf","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAM-exkB2Erc96kCF_TnLxORZFYeJ6KTS_k,NAME_SEARCH,laXs)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2018},"description":"Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) is one of the most commonly employed synthetic hydrophilic (nonionic) excipient in pharmaceutical formulations.

The availability of successful anticancer agents in the market is limited, and the development process of a new drug molecule is slow and difficult. The currently available commercial formulations are not sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic response within a specific time limit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel nanocarrier-based therapies to defeat the restrictions of existing therapeutics. Nanoparticles have been investigated as novel formulations but are often inefficient in practical applications. However, several unanswered questions and challenges exist in their clinical development; thus, a better understanding of their influence on cancer biology, stability, and toxicity needs to be gained. This review discusses different types of lung cancers as well as diagnostic approaches to lung cancer. The review also explores the drug targeting mechanisms to cancer cells through nanoparticles and multi-drug resistance-associated challenges in lung cancer therapy.

The global dementia prevalence is approximately 47 million, which may increase by three times by 2050. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. AD is a severe age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by short-term memory loss, aphasia, mood imbalance, and executive function. The etiology of AD is still unknown, and the exact origin of the disease is still under investigation. Aggregation of Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques or neurotoxic A\u03b2o oligomers outside the neuron is the most common cause of AD development. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by \u03b2 secretase and \u03b3 secretase produces abnormal A\u03b2 monomers. This aggregation of A\u03b2 and NFT is promoted by various genes like BACE1, ADAM10, PIN1, GSK-3, APOE, PPAR\u03b1, etc. Identification of these genes can discover several therapeutic targets that can be useful in studying pathogenesis and underlying treatments. Melatonin modulates the activities of these genes, thereby reducing A\u03b2 production and increasing its clearance. Melatonin also reduces the expression of APP by attenuating cAMP, thereby enhancing the non-amyloidogenic process.

Particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, and entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles were in the range of 95.6 \u00b1 3.4 nm to 440.9 \u00b1 7.3 nm, 12.8 \u00b1 0.8 mV to 27.3 \u00b1 1.1 mV, 0.289 \u00b1 0.011 to 0.571 \u00b1 0.011, and 54.36 \u00b1 1.26 % to 79.67 \u00b1 1.40 %, respectively. The XRD spectrum of formulation CMP-5 confirmed the amorphous nature of the loaded drug in nanoparticles. TEM image confirmed the spherical shape of nanoparticles. Atomic force microscopic image of formulation CMP-5 indicated a mean surface roughness of 10.3597 nm. The magnetization saturation of formulation CMP-5 was 24.74 emu\/g. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that formulation CMP-5's g-Lande's factor was 4.27, which was extremely near to the 4.30 (usual for Fe3+ ions). Residual paramagnetic Fe3+ ions may be responsible for paramagnetic origin. The data suggests superparamagnetic nature of particles. Formulations released 28.66 \u00b1 1.22 % to 53.24 \u00b1 1.95 % and 70.13 \u00b1 1.72 % to 92.48 \u00b1 1.32 % of the loaded drug after 24 h in pH 6.8 and pH 1.2, respectively. The IC50 value of formulation CMP-5 was 54.75 \u03bcg\/mL in HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines).","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0141813023018135","name":"Chitosan based sorafenib tosylate loaded magnetic nanoparticles: Formulation and in-vitro characterization","publisher":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"}]},{"name":"Rational design of linkers in polymer drug conjugates","publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":5,"year":2023},"publisher":"Academic Press (Elsevier)","url":"https:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/books\/polymer-drug-conjugates\/madan\/978-0-323-91663-9","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":10,"year":2023},"description":"Delivery of therapeutics to the central nervous system for treating psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, is a rigorous task due to the presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebro-spinal fluid barrier.

Intranasal drug delivery has gained emerging interest as the nasal cavity is in close proximity to the brain. It also contains nerves, which provide direct delivery of drugs to the brain. It is a non-invasive method with no first-pass metabolism, high absorption, high permeability, and better patient compliance.

Symptoms include lump formation in the breast, a change in the texture or color of the breast, or a discharge from the nipple. Local or systemic therapy is frequently used to treat breast cancer. Surgical and radiation procedures limited to the affected area are examples of local management. There has been significant worldwide progress in the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) since 1986, when the first therapeutic mAb, Orthoclone OKT3, became commercially available. mAbs can resist the expansion of cancer cells by inducing the destruction of cellular membranes, blocking immune system inhibitors, and preventing the formation of new blood vessels. mAbs can also target growth factor receptors. Understanding the molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and its microenvironment is crucial for developing effective targeted cancer therapeutics. Due to their unique properties, mAbs have a wide range of clinical applications. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are drugs that improve the therapeutic index by combining an antigen-specific antibody with a payload. This review focuses on the therapeutic applications, mechanistic insights, characteristics, safety aspects, and adverse events of mAbs like trastuzumab, bevacizumab, pertuzumab, ertumaxomab, and atezolizumab in breast cancer treatment. The creation of novel technologies utilizing modified antibodies, such as fragments, conjugates, and multi-specific antibodies, must be a central focus of future studies.

AD is identified by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which include abnormally phosphorylated tau-protein and amyloid protein (amyloid plaques). Peptide dysregulation is caused by an imbalance between the production and clearance of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and NFT. AD begins to develop when these peptides are not cleared from the body. As a result, understanding the processes that control both normal and pathological protein recycling in neuronal cells is critical. Insufficient A\u03b2 and NFT clearance are important factors in the development of AD. Autophagy, lysosomal dysfunction, and ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction have potential roles in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in AD. Modulation of these pathways may provide a novel treatment strategy for AD. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have recently emerged as important biological regulators, with particular relevance to the emergence and development of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. ncRNAs can be used as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers due to their critical regulatory functions in several biological processes involved in disease development, such as the aggregation and accumulation of A\u03b2 and NFT. It is evident that ncRNAs play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. In this communication, we explored the link between ncRNAs and AD and their regulatory mechanisms that may help in finding new therapeutic targets and AD medications.","url":"https:\/\/benthamscience.com\/article\/133244","name":"Non-coding RNAs in Regulation of Protein Aggregation and Clearance Pathways: Current Perspectives Towards Alzheimer's Research and Therapy","publisher":"Current Gene Therapy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUwIHMBap7NXHIJLaF3yLLIRyBneXV5xAw,NAME_SEARCH,4gA0)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":6,"year":2022},"description":"This method was first invented in the year 1858 and after the proper\nresearch, this method was easy to be applied in synthetic dye industry.

The progression of reaction and the\nmechanism concerned in this method was first predictable by scientist Peter Griess.\nThe major mechanism of this method is when the aromatic amine which is primary in\nnature essentially starts a reaction with acidic environment consisting of sodium nitrite,\nwhich is further changed into diazonium salt. A diazonium salt is fashioned which is\nclose with one other amine (phenol), and distorted into intense colored azo dye. The\nbasic principle concerned in this method is based on the amines which are primary\naromatic in nature, after that the sample reacts with sodium nitrite compound in the\noccurrence of HCl hydrochloric acid to form a diazonium salt. The end point is\ndetected by the formation of the blue colour with starch iodide paper. Another method\nfor the detection of end point is by immersing the platinum electrodes in the resulting\nsolution and it is also detected by the dead-stop end point method. The different\ntitration method includes direct method, indirect method and other method used in\nDiazotization technique. In the procedure, a potentiometer and electrode system were\nused, and the deflection is observed. The temperature of the reaction was maintained at\n0-5 \u00b0C.

Understanding the influence of temperature on rheological properties is quite important for polymeric materials to be considered as pharmaceutical excipients. Thus, a polymeric solution of purified Babool gum was prepared, and the influence of temperature on its rheological behaviour (viscosity and surface tension) was investigated to develop a better understanding of the structural organization of the gum. Furthermore, viscosity, surface tension, temperature coefficient, activation energy, Gibbs free energy, Reynolds number, and entropy of fusion were calculated using the Arrhenius, Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz, Frenkel\u2013Eyring, and Eotvos equations, respectively. The activation energy of the gum was 3.81 \u00b1 0.18 kJ\/mol. Changes in entropy and enthalpy were 0.56 \u00b1 0.23 and 4.27 \u00b1 0.81 kJ\/mol, respectively.

Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying AD are unknown. There are many hypotheses that define the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease among which the amyloid cascade hypothesis is widely accepted.

Amyloid-\u03b2-mediated dysregulation of calcium ions homeostasis has been extensively studied to understand the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration observed in AD. Amyloid-\u03b2 and tau interact with the calcium and calcium ion channels on the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria of the neuronal cells to form the vicious circle of calcium load and amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation. The disruption in calcium homeostasis accompanies changes as observed in the whole brain pathology of AD. This includes synaptic dysfunction, impaired cognition, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell apoptosis. This presents an immense need for a variety of potential therapeutic targets that could prevent or slow the progression of AD.

Second, we discussed an overview of existing therapies for RA and their limitations. The paper outlined various lipid-based vesicular systems like liposomes, transferosomes, ethosomes, transethosomes, cubosomes, phytosomes, lipid polymer hybrids, and miscellaneous vesicles like aspasomes, spanlastics, glycerosomes, ufasomes, pharmacosomes, and flavosomes for the effective treatment of RA. Finally, we outlined the gray zones of lipid-based vesicular drug delivery systems and regulatory considerations for lipid-based delivery vesicles. Patents unveiling lipid vesicles, with a special emphasis on liposomes reported for the treatment of RA, have been discussed.
