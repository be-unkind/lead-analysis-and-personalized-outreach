{"summary":"Working and setting a standard while changing lives one resident at a time. Goal oriented and people focused Life Enrichment professional at one of the best Senior Living companies. Working to grow and learn more about making lives of our residents better.\n\nI started out in senior living when I was 17 years old. I worked as a server in our AL dining room. This is where I realized I wanted to do more. I loved every single one of my residents and I wanted to show them how much I cared. When the opportunity came up, I applied and became a personal liaison. I learned that seniors have lives out side the dining room. My world opened up. \n\nI went on to finish school and began working in the fitness field leading exercise groups with seniors. After that a door opened up and an Executive Director took a gamble on me and hired me as the Activities Director. I have never looked back. \n\nI enrich the lives of my residents. I provide them with new things to learn and experience. We learn about science, reminisce about the good old days, even sometimes we get together and write a story or two. I have learned how to adapt my activities for those with greater dementia decline to even those with sight loss.  I find new and interesting ways every day on how to make their day the best that I can. \n\nCostumer service to me means... You never say no. You do your best.","lastName":"Snezhkova, CADDCT, CDP, ADC","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:115762125","geoRegion":"Houston, Texas, United States","fullName":"Katie Snezhkova, CADDCT, CDP,
