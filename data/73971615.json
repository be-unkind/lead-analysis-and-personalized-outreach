By Abid Ali Awan , KDnuggets Assistant Editor on April 4, 2024 in Programming Image generated with DALLE-3 Learning computer science from scratch can be quite difficult, and you might feel discouraged before you even begin. However, the open-source community on GitHub has created a wealth of resources that can guide you through this journey. In this blog post, we will explore 10 essential GitHub repositories that can help you learn the necessary concepts and tools to master computer science and secure a job at a top tech company. The repository contains community-driven road maps that have become increasingly popular among developers, providing interactive and comprehensive guides for learning various technologies and programming languages.\u00a0 These roadmaps cover a wide range of topics, including frontend, backend, DevOps, full stack, computer science, data structures, AI, data science, MLOps, QA, Python, software architecture, game development, software design, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, and more.\u00a0 The Open Source Society University (OSSU) offers a free, comprehensive, and community-driven computer science curriculum that provides a complete education in fundamental computer science concepts. The curriculum is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors at leading universities and taught by professors from prestigious institutions such as MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.\u00a0 The coursework covers essential topics such as programming languages, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer architecture, and software engineering, with advanced electives available for specialization.\u00a0 freeCodeCamp is the platform that offers free courses and tutorials on all kinds of computer technologies. It also provides a friendly and supportive community for individuals looking to learn coding skills. freeCodeCamp, run by a charity organization, aims to assist millions of adults in transitioning into tech careers. It provides a comprehensive and self-paced curriculum in full-stack web development and machine learning, featuring thousands of interactive coding challenges to enhance coding abilities. The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning system design principles and preparing for system design interviews. It is maintained by Donne Martin, a software engineer who has worked at companies like Amazon and Google. It covers a wide range of topics related to designing large-scale systems, including topics such as: system design basics, key characteristics of distributed systems, system design problems, Anki Flashcards, and system design interview questions with solutions. It is a community-driven project aimed to provide a curated list of high-quality programming books that can be accessed and downloaded for free, covering a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and related topics. It provides free books in English and also other languages like Arabic, Korean, Italian, Tamil, and more. The repository also provides additional resources like multi language courses on various programming languages, Interactive programming resources, podcast, and programming playgrounds. It is a list of awesome computer science opportunities and resources for students and professionals.\u00a0 It covers a wide range of topics, including competitive programming platforms, web development tutorials, mobile development courses, DevOps bootcamps, data science competitions, artificial intelligence resources, computer science fundamentals, open-source projects, cybersecurity blogs, online courses (MOOCs), fellowships and scholarships, programming events and hackathons, general opportunities like student packs, and community-driven demo projects.\u00a0 The list aims to provide a comprehensive collection of valuable resources to help individuals learn, practice, excel in various areas of computer science. The repository contains a study plan for becoming a software engineer at a large company, compiled by jwasham. It is meant for individuals who do not have a formal computer science education or degree just like the author. The study plan is comprehensive and aims to cover most of the important topics typically taught in a university computer science program, with a focus on data structures, algorithms, and coding interview preparation.\u00a0 It provides a structured approach, including a table of contents, daily plan, coding practice, and a list of topics to study. It is a repository that contains a collection of well-written, step-by-step guides for recreating various technologies from scratch. It aims to provide a great way to learn and understand different technologies by building them from the ground up. The repository is structured into different categories, each focusing on a specific type of technology like 3D Renderer, Augmented Reality, Command-Line Tool, Database, Docker, Game, Git, and more. Each category contains a list of links to tutorials, articles, and resources that guide users through the process of building various technologies from scratch. Public APIs is a curated list of free APIs that developers can explore and integrate into their projects with ease. These APIs cover a wide range of categories, from animals and entertainment to finance and health, providing access to data and services that would otherwise be time-consuming and costly to develop in-house. One of the key advantages of using public APIs is the ability to enhance your product's features rapidly and build MVP fast. For instance, if you're building a car-related app, you can seamlessly integrate a Public API that provides information about different types of cars. This not only saves development time but also ensures that your users have access to accurate and up-to-date data. It is a curated list of awesome lists on GitHub that cover a wide range of interesting topics. These lists contain resources organized by various categories such as platforms, programming languages, development tools, and more.\u00a0 The Awesome list is a massive community project where community members create a pull request and update the existing list. It is the only resource that you will ever need while learning about various tools and concepts of computer science. The awesome list is also useful for professionals who want to build durable and secure applications. Whether you are a novice or an expert in the field, these resources are designed to meet a diverse range of skill levels and interests. They not only establish a strong foundation in fundamental computer science concepts but also provide roadmaps for the specialization and exploration of state-of-the-art technologies. The true power of these GitHub repositories lies in their collaborative nature. They are maintained and contributed to by passionate developers and educators from around the world, ensuring that the content remains up-to-date, relevant, and constantly evolving.
