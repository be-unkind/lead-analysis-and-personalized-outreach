struck by how intransparent this industry was. Want to download standards? Please pay money for a PDF. Need templates? Purchase them from consultants. Have questions? Ask a consultant, get billed by the hour. I thought this sucked. Gatekeepers in this industry were optimizing for their own, short-term gains, while prohibiting advancement of the field as a whole. I thought I could make a change, and that was how OpenRegulatory was born. I thought: As long as I can be profitable as a consultant, I can give away lots of stuff for free. That would enable startups who don\u2019t have any funds to pay me to get their documentation done by themselves. Since then, OpenRegulatory even more free templates , and nowadays they are so complete that you can essentially do an entire medical device submission by yourself, for free! That\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019ve witnessed many startups enter the market who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to, because they built their company with their own savings, and paying a consultant was not feasible. And, on the other side, I\u2019ve heard from multiple Notified Bodies that they see many submissions based on the OpenRegulatory templates, and they generally like those, because they tend to be quite complete, yet also not exceedingly long. That\u2019s awesome! In 2022, we took that even further by offering our own QMS software, Formwork . The thinking here was quite the same: If we manage to make this profitable, let\u2019s give away as much as we can for free. That\u2019s how the Formwork Community Edition came to be, which (still) is probably the only, 100% free QMS software for document management out there. Unlimited users, too! This was another stepping stone in supporting those bootstrapped startups, where 3 dudes or dudesses are sitting in a cold garage, furiously hacking away on their medical device prototype, willing to put in grueling hours and suffer unlimited pain, because they\u2019re creating their MDR documentation by themselves. Mad props. Still, there was a wrinkle: To make things profitable, we had to price the paid versions of Formwork quite highly: 499\u20ac or 799\u20ac per month. Now - this actually isn\u2019t a high price if you compare us to other QMS software providers. Those typically have higher prices, multi-year contracts, limited user seats and no data export (good luck with the lock-in). So, if you compare Formwork to those, Formwork wins easily, and many companies are slowly realizing that, too. I regularly talk to companies who reach out whether they can migrate to Formwork to save money, and they\u2019re tired of dealing with their shady QMS salespeople. So Formwork is cool, and the price point is great. But here\u2019s the problem: For the three dudes in the garage, 499\u20ac per month is not great. And those dudes are not comparing Formwork to other QMS software, they\u2019re comparing it to generic software which might do the job, but is priced much lower: Software like Google Drive and Confluence ( ugh ). What usually happens next? I\u2019ve seen this time and time again: The three dudes choose Confluence. Initially, they would be happy with their choice. But, a few months down the line, preparing their audit submission, the pain would start. Creating and maintaining regulatory documentation in a generic tool which is not purpose-built is, at minimum, a full-time regulatory job. But, in reality, it\u2019s much worse than that: Because it was not purpose-built, it has evolved into a gigantic mess of epic proportions, resembling a \u201cFrankenstein\u201d-like monster where different systems, plugins and custom scripts have been stitched together in a very broken way. And the output still sucks, because essential stuff (e.g. traceability) is missing. So choosing Confluence, or Google Drive, or Notion usually ends up spawning this sort of Zombie-like apocalypse in your startup. Not great. But even worse, the founders only realize this when it\u2019s too late. They\u2019ve been using Confluence for a long time, preparing their audit submission, and only now realize that it\u2019s a huge mess. This is a lose-lose situation, because your options are: And the root case was somewhat our fault, because Formwork was too expensive for the three dudes in the garage. That\u2019s why, today, we\u2019re introducing Formwork Starter: Everything in Formwork, at a much lower price, so that the three dudes in the garage no longer choose Confluence. Formwork Starter is, quite literally, our full Formwork software at a fraction of its price. No strings attached! It\u2019s our offer to early-stage startups so that they don\u2019t screw up by choosing Confluence. We don\u2019t like limiting user seats or storage, because both things lead to weird workarounds (shared user accounts etc.) and are shady anyway. That\u2019s why we base this offer on a trust-based approach which looks at your company\u2019s situation. Specifically, to qualify for Formwork Starter, your company should have: .. and they need to be sitting in a garage. Just kidding. But the prior three points still stand. And once you have funding or revenue, simply reach out to us to upgrade to the normal price. So now, there\u2019s really nothing holding you back from choosing Formwork for your medical device startup. Give it a try! For now, we\u2019re testing Formwork Starter with a limited number of customers.

QMS software has huge leverage in saving you lots of time due to automation - but it's not available to the three dudes in the garage, because QMS software has historically been very expensive. Even our own!
