{"summary":"I am an Assistant Professor and, together with my team of technical and clinical researchers, I develop and improve (quantitative) MRI techniques for personalizing treatment in tumour patients at Amsterdam UMC. Such imaging biomarkers allow us to assess tumour properties such as their perfusion, cell density, elastic properties and oxygenation. This information helps us determine the best personalized treatment option. I work closely with radiologists, oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, and other health care professionals to provide clinicians with the best quality quantitative MRI for this purpose. \n\nDuring my studies (Physics), I developed the technical insight and tools needed for developing new MRI techniques. I obtained my PhD at Amsterdam UMC on \"MRI of pancreatic cancer for radiotherapy purposes\", during which I became an expert on quantitative imaging and initiated the development of IVIM-DWI scanning and all of the IVIM-DWI scans performed at the Amsterdam UMC are based on sequence and post-processing toolboxes I developed. During my Postdoc, at the Institute of Cancer Research, I become an expert on deep learning for quantitative MRI. I am currently at the Amsterdam UMC, where I lead a team of PhD candidates and master students.","lastName":"Gurney-Champion","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:99125569","geoRegion":"Weesp, North Holland,

incoherent motion (IVIM) model for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI data bears much promise as a tool for visualizing tumours and monitoring treatment response. To improve the currently poor precision of IVIM, several fit algorithms have been suggested. In this work, we compared the performance of two Bayesian IVIM fit algorithms and four other IVIM fit algorithms for pancreatic cancer imaging. DWI data were acquired in 14 pancreatic cancer patients during two MRI examinations. Three different measures of performance of the fitting algorithms were assessed: (i) uniqueness of fit parameters (Spearman\u2019s rho); (ii) precision (within-subject coefficient of variation, wCV); and (iii) contrast between tumour and normal-appearing pancreatic tissue. For the diffusivity D and perfusion fraction f, a Bayesian fit (IVIM-Bayesian-lin) offered the best trade-off between tumour contrast and precision. With the exception for IVIM-Bayesian-lin, all algorithms resulted in a very poor precision of the pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* with a wCV of more than 50%. The pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* of the Bayesian approaches were, however, significantly correlated with D and f. Therefore, the added value of fitting D* was considered limited in pancreatic cancer patients. The easier implemented least squares fit with fixed D* (IVIM-fixed) performed similar to IVIM-Bayesian-lin for f and D. In conclusion, the best performing IVIM fit algorithm was IVM-Bayesian-lin, but an easier to implement least squares fit with fixed D* performs similarly in pancreatic cancer patients.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0194590","name":"Comparison of six fit algorithms for the intra-voxel incoherent motion model of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of pancreatic cancer patients","publisher":"PloS one","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXoiUEBY4xhOPqEqFumlBK_vslSD-Nschc,NAME_SEARCH,15_2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAj3JzsBFMGA0C72_5mDv9f3aC42FtghrVM,NAME_SEARCH,K4Jm)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEv-m4B-dSbx6BnTB78zYW9Y0wn6bipz7E,NAME_SEARCH,L4ws)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABAPgoBhPeyYz_pFQKSFtfWbMT7f9fcTWM,NAME_SEARCH,nysK)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":1,"year":2018},"description":"Purpose\nTo compare six diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI models for response evaluation in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nConclusions\nIndividual treatment evaluation is possible with all investigated DWI models, with treatment associated changes exceeding the repeatability.

Up to now there have been no direct observations of this mechanism in humans. We studied the effects of systemic sympathetic activation elicited by a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) on renal blood flow (RBF) and renal oxygenation in healthy humans.\n\nMethods\nEight healthy volunteers (age 19\u201331 years) were subjected to progressive LBNP at \u2212 15 and \u2212 30 mmHg, 15 min per level. Brachial artery blood pressure was monitored intermittently. RBF was measured by phase-contrast MRI in the proximal renal artery. Renal vascular resistance was calculated as the MAP divided by the RBF. Renal oxygenation (R2*) was measured for the cortex and medulla by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI, using a monoexponential fit.\n\nResults\nWith a LBNP of \u2212 30 mmHg, pulse pressure decreased from 50\u2009\u00b1\u200910 to 43\u2009\u00b1\u20097 mmHg; MAP did not change. RBF decreased from 1152\u2009\u00b1\u200980 to 1038\u2009\u00b1\u200983 mL\/min to 950\u2009\u00b1\u200967 mL\/min at \u2212 30 mmHg LBNP (p\u2009=\u20090.013).

Regions of interest in the left and right liver lobe, pancreas, spleen, renal cortex, and renal medulla were delineated independently by 2 readers. DNNs were trained for IVIM model fitting using these data; results were compared to least\u2010squares and Bayesian approaches to IVIM fitting.

This approach was associated with high consistency between the 2 readers (ICCs between 50% and 97%), low intersubject variability of estimated parameter values (CVs between 9.2 and 28.4), and the lowest error when compared with least\u2010squares and Bayesian approaches.

However, these images are typically degraded by noise, as they do not utilize the information from the full acquisition. We present a principal component analysis (PCA) approach for model-free denoising of DWI data. PCA-denoising was compared to synthetic MRI, where a diffusion model is fitted for each voxel and a denoised image at a given b-value is generated from the model fit. A quantitative comparison of systematic and random errors was performed on data simulated using several diffusion models (mono-exponential, bi-exponential, stretched-exponential and kurtosis). A qualitative visual comparison was also performed for in vivo images in six healthy volunteers and three pancreatic cancer patients. In simulations, the reduction in random errors from PCA-denoising was substantial (up to 55%) and similar to synthetic MRI (up to 53%). Model-based synthetic MRI denoising resulted in substantial (up to 29% of signal) systematic errors, whereas PCA-denoising was able to denoise without introducing systematic errors (less than 2%). In vivo, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sharpness of PCA-denoised images were superior to synthetic MRI, resulting in clearer tumour boundaries. In the presence of motion, PCA-denoising did not cause image blurring, unlike image averaging or synthetic MRI. Multi-b-value MRI can be denoised model-free with our PCA-denoising strategy that reduces noise to a level similar to synthetic MRI, but without introducing systematic errors associated with the synthetic MRI method.","url":"https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6560\/ab1786\/meta","name":"Principal component analysis fosr fast and model-free denoising of multi b-value diffusion-weighted MR images","publisher":"PMB","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXoiUEBY4xhOPqEqFumlBK_vslSD-Nschc,NAME_SEARCH,15_2)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":3,"year":2019},"description":"Delineation variation of esophageal tumors remains a large source of geometric uncertainty. In the present study, we investigated the inter- and intra-observer variation in esophageal gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and the impact of endoscopically implanted fiducial markers on these variations.\n\nTen esophageal cancer patients with at least two markers endoscopically implanted at the cranial and caudal tumor borders and visible on the planning computed tomography (pCT) were included in this study. Five dedicated gastrointestinal radiation oncologists independently delineated GTVs on the pCT without markers and with markers. The GTV was first delineated on pCTs where markers were digitally removed and next on the original pCT with markers. Both delineation series were executed twice to determine intra-observer variation. For both the inter- and intra-observer analyses, the generalized conformity index (CIgen), and the standard deviation (SD) of the distances between delineated surfaces (i.e., overall, longitudinal, and radial SDs) were calculated. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare the without and with markers series (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05).\n\nBoth the inter- and intra-observer CIgen were significantly larger in the series with markers than in the series without markers (p\u2009<\u2009.001).
