{"summary":"With a fascination for the 400 billion T cells navigating our immune system (Jenkins et al., 2009), I've spent five years as a postdoc unraveling the specifics of antigen recognition by T cell receptors. This involved studying antigen specific CD4+ T \/ Treg cells related to autoimmune diseases or viral infections in humans. My journey into the immune system began as a graduate student, where I immersed myself in the realm of thymocyte development. \nPassionate about engineering immune cells, I aim to translate scientific insights into novel therapies for unmet patient needs.","lastName":"Wen","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:906423528","geoRegion":"United States","fullName":"Xiaomin Wen","firstName":"Xiaomin","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"AstraZeneca","description":"Cell therapy","title":"Senior Scientist","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"10001+","headquarters":{"geographicArea":"Cambridgeshire","country":"United Kingdom","city":"Cambridge","postalCode":"CB2 0AA","line2":"Cambridge Biomedical Campus","line1":"1 Francis Crick Avenue"},"website":"http:\/\/www.astrazeneca.com","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/astrazeneca\/","industry":"Pharmaceutical Manufacturing"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:1603","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1},"startedOn":{"month":6,"year":2023}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADYG7OgBQChEH9F0FHX2FAG8Tmg_MsqPhcM,NAME_SEARCH,kwOh)","projects":[],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Pharmaceutical Manufacturing","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2012},"degree":"Doctor of Philosophy -
