{"summary":"I am a graduate of the Islamic International Dental College (IIDC) in Islamabad, and I am currently serving as a house officer at the Islamic International Dental Hospital (IIDH) with certification in endodontic and restorative dentistry. My professional journey includes a tenure as a dentist at Westridge Dental Clinic, preceded by a role as a dental intern at Link Road Dental Clinic. These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of dental procedures, clinical management practices, adherence to hygiene standards, and the importance of effective communication in patient care.\n\nIn addition to my clinical practice, I am actively involved as a liaison officer for APDSA-Pakistan. In this role, I facilitate collaboration among dental students in Pakistan and internationally, fostering a broader and more creative interaction within the dental community.\n\nMy passion for unconventional research in public health led me to conduct a cross-sectional study on the effect of pregnancy on oral pigmentation. This study involved investigating the oral cavity soft tissues of 1000 pregnant and non-pregnant females from various hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Currently, I am engaged in a project focusing on the early childhood prediction of dental caries using a Machine Learning Model.\n\nOutside of dentistry, I have a strong commitment to Social Work, with over 5 years of experience. I am certified in organizing and participating in various community service activities, including dental camps, plantation drives, oral hygiene awareness campaigns, workshops, and conferences for different international organizations.\n\nI am eager to continue expanding my skills and knowledge, with the goal of applying innovative approaches to dentistry for the benefit of my community.","lastName":"Malik","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:851497102","geoRegion":"Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, Pakistan","fullName":"Dr Arooba Malik","firstName":"Dr Arooba","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Asia Pacific Dental Students Association","title":"Liaison Officer","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1,"numMonths":9},"companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"11-50","headquarters":{"country":"Cambodia","city":"Phnom Penh"},"website":"https:\/\/www.apdsa.org","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/asia-pacific-dental-student-association\/","industry":"Hospitals and Health Care"},"startedOn":{"month":8,"year":2023},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:54300436"}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADLA0I4BLmrqhUnhRg9o3C70xpwCZUnP35k,NAME_SEARCH,H_NK)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1690437087915?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=m7r_0NKaYWUe4ErXAQKkPp1SLisWY1tmT6Lye7xzkGA","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1690437087915?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=e-yOZEnSTJ6QkhpmTdNmjc02btp3M0c8-oZfrt0D3Hg","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1690437087916?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=vCptFYO9yMJZXbJ2j1BnSSPWtBZIsd0EnbFnsXFsZGk","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1690437087916?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=Xz4l9IoBb34lECvSxDbiqpMAqA41AMsSCvRR1JnMOVg","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D03AQFGzVAI68RB9w\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":7,"year":2023},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADLA0I4BLmrqhUnhRg9o3C70xpwCZUnP35k,NAME_SEARCH,H_NK)"}],"description":"Develop original and engaging TSA questions, similar to UCAT, logic, reasoning, GMAT, and GRE and tutor them to people too. \nEnsure questions are accurate, clear, and aligned with the latest test standards and guidelines with provided answers and detailed solutions. \nConduct thorough research to maintain a high level of expertise in the subject matter and stay updated on the latest trends and developments in the test prep industry. \nCollaborate with the team to review and refine questions, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and overall quality. \nMonitor user feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement and incorporate insights into future question development.","title":"Upwork Project - Expert level questions maker & tutor - Logic\/UCAT\/Reasoning\/SAT\/GMAT\/GRE","startedOn":{"month":3,"year":2023}},{"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADLA0I4BLmrqhUnhRg9o3C70xpwCZUnP35k,NAME_SEARCH,H_NK)"}],"description":"The aim of this investigation to determine a difference, if any, between the patterns and intensity of oral pigmentation between women who have undergone pregnancies and those who have not in the absence of any systemic or local disease.
