Therefore, it seemed logical to establish a base line regarding the normal range of mouth opening of the population. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the normal range of mouth opening of the population of Jamshedpur. Settings and Design: Clinical in vitro study Methods and Material: A total 216 subjects from age 20 to 83 years were studied. Subjects with a history of trauma to or surgery in face, head and neck region, developmental anomaly, and psychiatric drug intake were excluded from the study. Measurements were taken twice and bigger reading was noted. Statistical analysis used: t test A mouth opening range from 25 mm to 67 mm was found Results: among the population. The average maximum mouth opening of 47.76 +\/- 7.98 mm and 45.41 +\/- 9.76 mm were found for males and females respectively. The maximum mouth opening for the population was 46.82 +\/- 8.8 mm. It was found that 41.2 % of the population fell in the MMO range of 41-50 mm; 28.24 % in 51-60 mm; and 18.98 % in 31-40 mm. Thus a total of 70 % of Jamshedpur population fell within a mouth opening range of 41-60 mm. Conclusions: A baseline data regarding the normal range of mouth opening of the Jamshedpur population was established. These indings can be used to arrive at a diagnosis in different disease conditions of restricted mouth opening.\n","url":"http:\/\/www.guident.net\/","name":"A STUDY TO ESTABLISH THE NORMAL RANGE OF MOUTH OPENING OF JAMSHEDPUR POPULATION","publisher":"Guident; Dec2012, Vol. 6 Issue 1, 98-104","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHKvlkBQxy8_G1ddzyQZLNcDvtz9KedQRM,NAME_SEARCH,rm-8)"}]},{"name":"Oral Tissue Trauma in an Adult Male by a Tooth Brush:A Case Report and Review of literature","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":1,"year":2015},"description":"The intraoral trauma by a tooth brush in an adult is a very rare occurrence, although it occurs frequently in children.
