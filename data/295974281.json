Here the peptide, dubbed littleSven, and modifications designed to probe the resilience of the sequence to self-assembly, is characterised. Although the parent peptide did not form a hydrogel, small modifications to the sequence (one side chain or an N-terminus modification) led to hydrogels with properties (eg. gelation time and rheology) that could be tuned by these small alterations. The results suggest that peptides derived from protein-protein interfaces are resilient to changes in sequence and can be harnessed to form hydrogels with controlled properties.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1742706116303476","name":"Controlling gelation with sequence: Towards programmable peptide hydrogels.","publisher":"Acta biomateriala","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGkNYkBvXcGVp6P7-putI0Gv-7EuC6SeNU,NAME_SEARCH,49xs)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOgw-cB0WpUQP_3AcLpIQRffRvzZcP0H7c,NAME_SEARCH,jgoL)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAnRj1kB3PSRvz-42Ttit7quR0FNW3Ai_d8,NAME_SEARCH,HzRi)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":7,"year":2015},"description":"Antimicrobial proteins are a rich source of new lead compounds for the development of new drugs that will tackle global resistance towards existing antibiotics.

Substitution of the 7Cys and 81Cys by two selenocysteine 7U and 81U afforded a selenocysteine analogue [7Sec-81Sec]-Cp-5, which displayed a higher stability (using thermal circular dichroism) compared to the native protein Cp-5.

Unlike classical antibiotics, with the exception of a few species, no acquired resistance towards antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been reported. Therefore, AMPs represent leads for the development of novel antibiotics. Caenopore-5 is constitutively expressed in the intestine of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and is a pore-forming AMP. The protein (82 amino acids) was successfully synthesised by using Boc solid-phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation. No \u03b3-linked by-product was observed despite the use of a C-terminal Glu-thioester. The folding of the synthetic protein was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism and compared with data recorded for recombinant caenopore-5. The permeabilisation activities of the protein and of shortened analogues were evaluated.","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201402513\/abstract","name":"Chemical Synthesis of A Pore-Forming Antimicrobial Protein, Caenopore-5, by Using Native Chemical Ligation at a Glu-Cys Site","publisher":"CHEMBIOCHEM","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGkNYkBvXcGVp6P7-putI0Gv-7EuC6SeNU,NAME_SEARCH,49xs)"}]},{"name":"Structure and dynamics of human Nedd4-1 WW3 in complex with the alphaENaC PY motif","publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":15,"year":2013},"publisher":"Biochim Biophys Acta","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23665454","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA4vipoBMe3yJCK5HGpRKJalFoH9xuXJLwU,NAME_SEARCH,qnwN)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGkNYkBvXcGVp6P7-putI0Gv-7EuC6SeNU,NAME_SEARCH,49xs)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAN-GmgBkRKDXGVbCwMehfJYwk5iTkZdZj0,NAME_SEARCH,1HIj)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOgw-cB0WpUQP_3AcLpIQRffRvzZcP0H7c,NAME_SEARCH,jgoL)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1712679180000,"insightId":"ee461f99-232a-423e-bbbd-73b2296f76e6","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E10AQEpBnSPcpjHGA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1712679233893?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=u6wdL9CoiN4aNILQG1V7lBXyCdyKal1TxanZqkXeMs0","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E10AQEpBnSPcpjHGA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1712679233893?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=u6wdL9CoiN4aNILQG1V7lBXyCdyKal1TxanZqkXeMs0"}]},"resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/bit.ly\/4atwTgr","title":"Initiating More Sustainable Practices in Biology - Get Started Now"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":5}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183497362302980097","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183497362302980097","reactionsCount":5,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183497361501888513","message":{"attributes":[{"start":1005,"length":15,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:sustainability"}}},{"start":1022,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:teammerck"}}}],"text":"\ud83d\udce2 Join our live webinar on \"More Sustainable Practices in Biology - Get Started Now\"!\nAre you ready to make a positive impact on our environment while advancing your biology research?
