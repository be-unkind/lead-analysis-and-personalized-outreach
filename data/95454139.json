They are transported from the ER to the Golgi, cleaved by S1P and S2P proteases and the released N-terminal domains act as transcription factors. CREB3 family members regulate the expression of a large variety of genes and according to their tissue-specific expression profiles they play, among others, roles in acute phase response, lipid metabolism, development, survival, differentiation, organelle autoregulation, and protein secretion. They have been implicated in the ER and Golgi stress responses as regulators of the cell secretory capacity and cell specific cargos. In this review we provide an overview of the diverse functions of each member of the family (CREB3, CREB3L1, CREB3L2, CREB3L3, CREB3L4) with special focus on their role in the central nervous system.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fcell.2019.00123","name":"The Role of Mammalian Creb3-Like Transcription Factors in Response to Nutrients","publisher":"Frontiers in Genetics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWwg7sBlyDnSlbs23FnwUwI9f57xcTIWms,NAME_SEARCH,0_f2)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":14,"year":2021},"description":"Ingestion of nutrients elicits essential physiological responses, including absorption, digestion, cessation of feeding and nutrient storage. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to this nutritional homeostasis, since it regulates intracellular organelle function, drives intercellular communication and promotes metabolite distribution. We identified the Drosophila Creb3L-family transcription factor, CrebA, as the key metabolic regulator of ER function, thereby affecting lipid metabolism and feeding behavior. In response to feeding, CrebA activity is rapidly and transiently activated. CrebA directly drives the expression of the ER protein sorting machinery. We demonstrate that CrebA levels regulate lipid metabolism through lipoprotein secretion into the hemolymph and suppress feeding behavior. Further, CrebA mouse homologs are also upregulated in the liver following feeding and drive the transcriptional activation of ER protein sorting machinery genes in mammals. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved transcription switch which is turned on in response to food ingestion and orchestrates a negative feedback loop that promotes satiety by regulating ER function and protein secretion.","url":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2021.03.13.435227v1","name":"A Creb3-Like Transcription Factor Coordinates ER Function upon Food Intake to Regulate Lipid Metabolism","publisher":"BioRxiv","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWwg7sBlyDnSlbs23FnwUwI9f57xcTIWms,NAME_SEARCH,0_f2)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714132080000,"insightId":"dd00c584-8fd6-4f8a-a82a-37dcf265f6f8","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":22},{"type":"PRAISE","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7189591117300940801","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7189591117300940801","reactionsCount":24,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7189591117300940801","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"It was great to be part of the event and engage with people driving innovation in the life sciences ecosystem \ud83d\ude4c"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:multiPhoto:1000167567554"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7189548821264105474","message":{"attributes":[{"start":215,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:66875124"}}},{"start":228,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:11707083"}}},{"start":241,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:151496726"}}},{"start":255,"length":5,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:72690736"}}},{"start":263,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:71668042"}}},{"start":281,"length":3,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:5870"}}},{"start":291,"length":19,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:196152215"}}},{"start":312,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:6405408"}}},{"start":371,"length":22,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:digitaltransformation"}}},{"start":490,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/efYjVdqC"}}}],"text":"Feeling inspired from our day in Leiden! \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 There\u2019s nothing more energizing than connecting with the scientists and technologists driving R&D innovation. \nThank you to everyone who joined, especially our speakers Aga Wegrzyn (EV Biotech), Elsa Lauwers (Paleo), Henning Redestig (IFF), and Tobias Wingberm\u00fchle (Clustermarket), who shared their insights on the impact of #digitaltransformation.\n\nDid you miss the event?
