William Timmons (R), Rep. Joe Wilson (R), Sen. Tim Scott (R), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R), and Rep. James Clyburn (D) for their continued support of the TBI Act.\nDavis, of Columbia, Norungolo, of Greenville, Robinson, of Columbia, and Grant, of Blythewood, were on hand to encourage the South Carolina legislators to reauthorize and fully fund the act, support TBI model systems funding, and join the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force. Both Wilson and Clyburn are active members of the task force.\n\u201cEach of us has a unique brain injury journey, which we were able to share with our lawmakers,\u201d said Norungolo, a Greenville, SC, native who experienced a TBI nearly 25 years ago. \u201cNo two brain injuries are alike. By coming together with others from across the United States we can communicate how important it is to have a more cohesive and proactive approach to treating individuals who experience concussion, TBI, stroke, and other brain injuries so that every incident is treated with the same level of care to promote the best possible outcome.\u201d\nThe TBI Act provides much-needed funding to improve rehabilitation and community support for people with brain injury; it is set to expire in 2024. The Brain Injury Association of America worked with its partners and key stakeholders to craft improvements to the TBI Act, including expanding program eligibility and recognizing brain injury as a chronic condition, like diabetes and heart disease.\n\u201cThe reauthorization of the TBI Act in 2024 is a pivotal opportunity to strengthen our nation\u2019s response to the significant prevalence and complex challenges associated with brain injury,\u201d said Rick Willis, president and CEO of the Brain Injury Association of America. \u201cWe\u2019re making the case that long-term support for people with brain injury should be improved through the reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. We urge Congress to consider these proposed improvements, informed by consensus within the brain injury community, to ensure that every individual affected by a brain injury receives the care and support they need to live functional and independent lives.\u201d \nFor more information, please visit https:\/\/www.biaofsc.com\/ or call 803-731-9823 for Executive Director, Joyce Davis."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7174835762591346688"}}},{"createdAt":1710263640000,"insightId":"1874c619-a742-4c7e-9549-08e590b2e558","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":2},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7173365671920029698","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7173365671920029698","reactionsCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7173365670615699456","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Super grateful for the journey!"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5622AQHv7zsDXH6L9A\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1710184823319?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=v7iQw_tWqsMMsxXe7eseqKociaViEFwo0A60MAW-9xA"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7173035050974765056","message":{"attributes":[{"start":107,"length":35,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:2545370"}}},{"start":896,"length":34,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:16541527"}}},{"start":932,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:519585532"}}},{"start":947,"length":36,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:721068"}}},{"start":985,"length":43,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:54447852"}}},{"start":1030,"length":42,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:61906248"}}},{"start":1074,"length":32,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:braininjuryassociationofamerica"}}},{"start":1107,"length":20,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:braininjuryadvocacy"}}},{"start":1128,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:braininjuryawarenessday"}}},{"start":1153,"length":5,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:biaa"}}}],"text":"So many firsts this last week:\n\n\u2714\ufe0f First rally on Capitol Hill\n\u2714\ufe0f First time getting to meet the team from Brain Injury Association of America in person\n\u2714\ufe0f First time getting to experience a client event where our branding was front and center\n\nSo proud of the BIAA team for executing a flawless Brain Injury Awareness Day. I was able to meet and talk with many brain injury survivors, hear their stories, and understand even more about why an organization like BIAA is so needed.\n\nOur agency has worked with nonprofit organizations since the beginning.

A huge thanks to the BIAA team for having me!\n\nDede Norungolo, CRC, LPC, LAC, ADC, Wendy Waldman, Brain Injury Association of Virginia, THE BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION OF INDIANA INC, Brain Injury Association of South Carolina\n\n#BrainInjuryAssociationofAmerica #BrainInjuryAdvocacy #BrainInjuryAwarenessDay #BIAA"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7173035050974765056"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7173365670615699456"}}},{"createdAt":1709902200000,"insightId":"d3653112-55de-41f2-a10a-3a48f1088d3b","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:multiPhoto:1000137850474"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":9},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":7}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7171849751028551680","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7171849751028551680","reactionsCount":16,"commentsCount":2,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7171849751028551680","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"One of my favorite things is learning about new \u201ctricks\u201d or ways to live a more peaceful life whether through technology or accommodations.
