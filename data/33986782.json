This target is still largely underexploited. Heparanase activity releases from the extracellular matrix (ECM) and tumor microenvironment a multitude of heparan sulphate (HS)-bound growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes that affect cells and tissue functions such as inflammation, wound healing and tumor invasion. A pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic role for this enzyme has been widely demonstrated in many primary human tumors since high levels of heparanase correlate with lymph node and distant metastasis, elevated microvessel density and reduced survival of cancer patients. Heparanase is up regulated in many human hematologic and solid tumors. Two HS mimetics, PG545 and Roneparstat, are in active clinical development, the former in solid tumors, and the latter in Multiple Myeloma (MM). \nThese progresses together with increasing and sound preclinical data suggesting a significant potential for anti-heparanase therapy in many types of tumors, underscores the need to explore\nthe full potential of this novel and safe therapeutic approach. This paper reviews the role of heparanase as novel therapeutic target in cancer and illustrates Roneparstat as a concrete\nexample of such potential.","publisher":"SciMedCentral J. of Pharamcology & Clinical Toxicology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIGmN4BSTZcR1G19IF8zEEcGEpbmRNI2tw,NAME_SEARCH,zcOP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAKp2lcBYuI_RWuP0HsMalreyqAkmum9RSA,NAME_SEARCH,gQOu)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":1,"year":2015},"description":"Recent studies have highlighted a key role in regulating gene transcription, in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, by enzymes that control the acetylation and deacetylation of histones.

Here we report the results of a study aimed at evaluating antiparasitic effect of two classes of HDAC-Is bearing different zinc binding group (hydroxamic acid vs thiol).

AvidinOX is produced by 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid (HABA)-assisted sodium periodate oxidation of Avidin. The peculiar property of the periodate-generated glycol-split carbohydrate moieties to form Schiff\u2019s bases with amino groups of the tissue proteins allows to achieve a tissue half-life of 2 weeks compared to 2 h of native Avidin. Carbohydrate oxidation, along with possible minor amino acid modifications, introduces additional microheterogeneity in the glycoprotein structure, making its characterization even more demanding than for native glycoproteins. Aiming at the elucidation of the effects of oxidation conditions on the AvidinOX protein backbone and sugars, this microheterogeneous glycoprotein derivative was characterized for the first time using a combination of different analytical methods, including colorimetric methods, mass spectrometry, hollow-fiber flow field-flow  fractionation with UV and multi-angle laser scattering detection (HF5-UV-MALS), and NMR.  \nThe proposed integrated approach reveals structural features of AvidinOX relevant for its biological activity, e.g., oxidized sites within both carbohydrate moieties and protein backbone and  conformational stability, and will be considered as an analytical tool for AvidinOX industrial preparations. It is worth noting that this study enriches also the structural data of native Avidin published up-to-date (e.g., glycan structure and distribution, peptide fingerprint, etc.).","url":"http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00216-017-0754-3","name":"Characterization of therapeutic protein AvidinOX by an integrated analytical approach","publisher":"Springer - Anal Bioanal Chem","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIGmN4BSTZcR1G19IF8zEEcGEpbmRNI2tw,NAME_SEARCH,zcOP)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":29,"year":2018},"description":"As an extension of our studies on the multifaceted properties of C-\u200balkylated resorc[4]\u200barenes, we planned to immobilize on a solid support resorc[4]\u200barenes with C11-\u200blong side chains in the lower rim.

The main oral disorders are associated with forms of oral dysbiosis that favour the development of periodontitis, a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease that results in the progressive destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. Possible consequences are tooth loss in adults and a risk factor for systemic complications, including cardiovascular disease and dysmetabolic diseases. From the etiological point of view, in a variable time frame the normal bacterial flora, consisting of Gram-positive species, is progressively substituted by a pathogenic \u201cred complex\u201d, consisting mainly of facultative intracellular anaerobic pathogens such as P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. denticola, T. forsythia, and P. melaninogenica. Currently, scaling and root planning (curettage) remains the \u201cgold standard\u201d treatment for periodontal diseases. In addition, dentists often prescribe antibiotics which exert only a temporary action. Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory substances are commonly used (i.e., chlorhexidine) although it may lead to undesirable side effect such as the pigmentation of teeth and oral tissues.

Therefore, inhibition of GLI activity is a good therapeutic option to suppress both canonical and noncanonical activation of the HH pathway. However, only a few GLI inhibitors are available, and none of them have the profile required for clinical development due to poor metabolic stability and aqueous solubility, and high hydrophobicity. Two promising quinoline inhibitors of GLI were selected by virtual screening and subjected to hit-to-lead optimization, thus leading to the identification of the 4-methoxy-8-hydroxyquinoline derivative JC19. This molecule impaired GLI1 and GLI2 activities in several cellular models interfering with the binding of GLI1 and GLI2 to DNA. JC19 suppressed cancer cell proliferation by enhancing apoptosis, inducing a strong anti-tumor response in several cancer cell lines in vitro. Specificity towards GLI1 and GLI2 was demonstrated by lower activity of JC19 in GLI1- or GLI2-depleted cancer cells. JC19 showed excellent metabolic stability and high passive permeability.

The usual approach is to bind the drug to the linker as a carbamate and release it as a free amine after a self-immolative 1,6-elimination. \nAlthough this approach is very efficient, it is limited to amines (as carbamates), alcohols or phenols (as carbonates) or other acidic functional groups. \nWe report here a self-immolative spacer capable of directly linking and releasing amines, phenols, thiols,\nsulfonamides and carboxyamides after a reductive stimulus. \nThe spacer is based on the structure of (5-nitro-2-pyrrolyl)methanol (NPYM-OH), which was used for the direct alkylation of the functional groups mentioned above. The spacer is metabolically stable and has three indispensable sites for bioconjugation: the bioresponsive trigger, the conjugated 1,6 self-immolative system and a third arm suitable for conjugation with a carrier or other modifiers. Release was achieved by selective reduction of the nitro group over Fe\/Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in a micellar aqueous environment (H2O\/TPGS-750-M), or by NADH mediated nitroreductase activation.

Aminopterin blocked a critical chemical reaction needed for DNA replication. \n\nThat drug was the predecessor of methotrexate, a cancer treatment drug used commonly today. \n\nSince then, other researchers discovered drugs that block different functions in cell growth and replication.

Parliamo di una proteina transmembrana scoperta nel 1997 da\u00a0Makoto Kuro-o, ricercatore giapponese della Jichi Medical University, un pioniere nella scienza dell'invecchiamento e della longevit\u00e0, ed esperto nella prevenzione delle malattie [https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d53tknyn]. \n\nQuesta proteina, prodotta dai reni e dal cervello, controlla la sensibilit\u00e0 delle cellule all'insulina e sarebbe anche coinvolta nel\u00a0processo di invecchiamento. \nPer quasi 30 anni Klotho \u00e8 stata oggetto di studi e approfondimenti ma negli ultimi anni l\u2019interesse sta progressivamente crescendo. \n\nDal 2014 ad oggi, ogni anno vengono pubblicati dai 200 ai 350 lavori, anche su riviste prestigiose come Nature [https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d-f3BzCP]. \n\nPERCHE\u2019 TANTO INTERESSE? \n\nPrincipalmente per il suo coinvolgimento nel processo di invecchiamento e nella possibilit\u00e0 di contrastare processi neurodegenerativi, come finora dimostrato in modelli animali. \n\nLa concentrazione nel sangue della proteina Klotho si riduce con l\u2019avanzare dell\u2019et\u00e0 e per questo, secondo gli studiosi, pu\u00f2 essere considerato un \u201cbiomarker dell\u2019invecchiamento\u201d.  \n\nLivelli elevati della proteina Klotho assicurerebbero longevit\u00e0 e salute. Una somministrazione di Klotho potrebbe riportare indietro l\u2019orologio biologico della nostra vita. \n\nStudiato in modelli animali (topi), una somministrazione di Klotho fa aumentare le funzioni sinaptiche e cognitive. I topi transgenici che iper-esprimono Klotho vivono pi\u00f9 a lungo (fra 19% e 31%) dei topi normali. \nContrariamente, nei topi privi di questa proteina i processi di invecchiamento sono accelerati cos\u00ec come i problemi cardiovascolari e la degenerazione degli organi, rispetto ad un\u2019analoga popolazione di topi con livelli normali di Klotho.\n \nAncora oggi la proteina Klotho rimane una molecola sperimentale. Quindi NON \u00e8 disponibile in farmacia e non \u00e8 possibile farsela prescrivere dal proprio medico. \n\nPer\u00f2 possiamo far aumentare il suo rilascio in modo naturale. Infatti, nei soggetti con uno stile di vita sano, che seguono una dieta ipocalorica, seguono periodi di digiuno intermittente, assumono pochi zuccheri, dormono regolarmente, tengono a bada lo stress e praticano una regolare attivit\u00e0 fisica, i livelli plasmatici della proteina Klotho sono pi\u00f9 elevati. \n#longevity #klotho #antiaging\n\nMaggiori info: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dysHJyne"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194065263997181952"}}},{"createdAt":1715188620000,"insightId":"f122c10a-78d2-4608-bd81-e74ae73dedff","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194022594642137090","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194022594642137090","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194022594642137090","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"THE LEARNING CYCLE: AN ENDLESS SCREW! \n\nIt would take at least a year\/layer to become familiar with this new science.\n\nCome on, let's start with the outer layer. \n\nAnd as soon as we finish we start again, since everything will already be old! \n\nAnd then the cycle begins again!"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5622AQHGOxNlxXNHGA\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715165182651?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=lcMk7Aec857eDkjI6FRPWWJyaV4d-fScp_rTkQsEuIY"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:groupPost:961087-7193924288553406464","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"AI Atmosphere\nCore skills and Knowledge layers\n\n1.

However, exactly how PARK7 fulfills its multifarious functions remains to be explored. This highlights the need for potent inhibitors and degraders that specifically target PARK7 in cells to explore PARK7 biology and advance drug discovery.\n\nA few small-molecule inhibitors were initially identified to bind PARK7, and this was later extended by a group of inhibitors based on the endogenous metabolite isatin, which bound PARK7 and reacted with Cys106 in a covalent manner.\n\nThe development of the cianimide-containing inhibitor JYQ-88,\u00a0along with two variants of fluorescent probes, which covalently react with PARK7 Cys106.\n\nTaking JYQ-88 as a starting point, two PARK7 inhibitors \u2013 JYQ-164 and JYQ-173 \u2013 have now been synthesized with submicromolar potency in cells. Both compounds bind specifically to PARK7 and react at the Cys106 residue in cells.\n\nAnother step forward towards the development of more potent and selective inhibitors, with a therapeutic potential that can be exploited clinically in both oncology and Parkinson's.\n#PARK7 #Parkinson #Cancer #PROTAC\n\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/dvbq4Yz6"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7193997731781083136"}}},{"createdAt":1715161560000,"insightId":"d2ab8b29-cbb0-490c-a517-a906a145d28d","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193909187490332672","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193909187490332672","reactionsCount":3,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193909186827632640","message":{"attributes":[{"start":691,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:livecellimaging"}}},{"start":708,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:chemmedchem"}}},{"start":722,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d-6tHUTh"}}}],"text":"OUT OF THE DARK, INTO THE LIGHT!\n\nThis is the incipit of title that the authors Chris Meier and J.
