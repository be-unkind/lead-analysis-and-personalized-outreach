The transcription factor p53 plays a major role in tumor suppression by maintaining genomic stability. Recent studies have suggested that amyloid formation of p53 could lead to its loss of physiological function as a tumor suppressor. Here, we investigated the intrinsic amyloidogenic nature of wild-type p53 using sequence analysis. We used bioinformatics and aggregation prediction algorithms to establish the evolutionarily conserved nature of aggregation-prone sequences in wild-type p53. Further, we analyzed the amyloid forming capacity of conserved and aggregation-prone p53-derived peptides PILTIITL and YFTLQI in vitro using various biophysical techniques including all atom molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, we probed the seeding ability of the PILTIITL peptide on p53 aggregation in vitro and in cells. Our data demonstrate the intrinsic amyloid forming ability of a sequence stretch of p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) and its aggregation-templating behavior on full-length and p53 core domain. Therefore, p53 aggregation, instigated through an amyloidogenic segment in its DBD, could be a putative driving force for p53 aggregation in vivo.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/bi500825d","name":"Investigating the intrinsic aggregation potential of evolutionarily conserved segments in p53.","publisher":"Biochemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANrEpYBM2cedZj7k5K1HqTnc43VZw2B56Y,NAME_SEARCH,6_5N)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":23,"year":2016},"description":"Amyloids are cross-\u03b2-sheet fibrillar aggregates, associated with various human diseases and native functions such as protein\/peptide hormone storage inside secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. In the current study, using amyloid detecting agents, we show that growth hormone (GH) could be stored as amyloid in the pituitary of rat. Moreover, to demonstrate the formation of GH amyloid in vitro, we studied various conditions (solvents, glycosaminoglycans, salts and metal ions) and found that in presence of zinc metal ions (Zn(II)), GH formed short curvy fibrils. The amyloidogenic nature of these fibrils was examined by Thioflavin T binding, Congo Red binding, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Our biophysical studies also suggest that Zn(II) initiates the early oligomerization of GH that eventually facilitates the fibrillation process. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence study of pituitary tissue, we show that GH in pituitary significantly co-localizes with Zn(II), suggesting the probable role of zinc in GH aggregation within secretory granules. We also found that GH amyloid formed in vitro is capable of releasing monomers. The study will help to understand the possible mechanism of GH storage, its regulation and monomer release from the somatotrophs of anterior pituitary.","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep23370","name":"Amyloid formation of growth hormone in presence of zinc: Relevance to its storage in secretory granules","publisher":"Nature Scientific Reports","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQUxScBxRB-siONPZQhttiXyctISye8__Q,NAME_SEARCH,Bjxb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANrEpYBM2cedZj7k5K1HqTnc43VZw2B56Y,NAME_SEARCH,6_5N)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAWhvOsB3aC1nCAyTFmRSIV9vFMgLGwBwJA,NAME_SEARCH,6z9L)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_MUy0BFwBuvcDhyKvEgWVxKpw247F-mKs,NAME_SEARCH,uIlv)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"year":2017},"description":"In the current study, we provide several evidences for the presence of p53 amyloid formation (in human and animal cancer tissues); along with its isolation from human cancer tissues and the biophysical characterization of these tissue-derived fibrils.
