{"summary":"\u201cQuality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction, and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.\u201d \u2013 William A. Foster\nThe above quote is one of my favorites and as a Biomedical Scientist, I am passionate about bringing Quality science, meaning a measure of excellence free from defects and significant variations. Few words about who I am.\n\u2022 I was born in India, moved to England to pursue PhD and post-doctoral studies, and worked for a few years there. I have learned to perform great science and realized what I want to do. \n\u2022 I firmly believe in and work for the mission of translational science to bring biomedical research into applications to ameliorate and cure human diseases. \n\u2022 Moved to Canada not long ago, love the country, and enjoy doing science here!\n\u2022 I have enjoyed scientific positions in Research and Development, Process development, and in Quality control throughout my career.\n\u2022 My passion, experience, and personal development achieved so far are highlighted here to learn more about me:\n\no I love to discuss science and the ways to translate discoveries!\no My Scientific background to summarize: I am a stem cell and cancer biologist with a special love to satellite cells of skeletal muscle.\no Experienced in designing and developing assays for the small molecules\/therapeutic proteins targeting cancer, and cell\/gene therapy for human diseases for clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III).\no Another part that I enjoy in addition to doing science is identifying the root cause of the problem to provide corrective action. Working in quality control, as a certified Lead Auditor in ISO 9001:2015 and a black belt holder in Lean Six Sigma, I have learned to troubleshoot starting from bench level to production.\no Acquired knowledge of the ICH, FDA, MHRA, and Health Canada guidelines and applied to the development, production, and release of small molecules.\no Strong coordination skills made it possible to work in multi-disciplinary, cross-functional teams.\no Worked with embryonic stem cells for ASTVAC2 project, on Satellite cells and revealed important information regarding the remodeling of Extracellular matrix components and its effects on stem cell propagation, as well as in regenerative medicine.\no Now working with an excellent team we are on a mission to cure Muscular Dystrophy!\n\n\nAlways happy to connect for science to share knowledge and to discuss translating modern Biomedical research!!","lastName":"R.","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:40728087","geoRegion":"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","fullName":"Shanti R.","firstName":"Shanti ","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Ottawa Hospital Research Institute","title":"Senior Research Associate","tenureAtCompany":{"numMonths":9},"companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"1001-5000","headquarters":{"country":"Canada","postalCode":"K1Y 4E9"},"website":"http:\/\/www.ohri.ca\/","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/ottawa-hospital-research-institute\/","industry":"Research Services"},"startedOn":{"month":9,"year":2023},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:514595"}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJtdhcB610t_h_oHibOnFQaqyLpbrGLYB8,NAME_SEARCH,WaNI)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1706654132167?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=I-L1UQlFGogZQ3-8BgRPgDlo2fLcAZPvjDTI9kqWKUs","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1706654132168?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=7sGSDj4uTPCTp2FR4iLR9b0DHSy2x_bXT65o-syxuFc","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1706654132168?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=PDmqNbG7LbBFAonhiWB5r2qikxK0Bp45Ok8usKh6EuI","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1706654132168?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=Ei4Eq49bGV3bSW0XwyPBb4CwkfQCa65uT9ABJa3DHgg","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5603AQGNk20_rpUfAg\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":3,"year":2017},"description":"Was actively involved in performing and training flow cytometry methods to identify dendritic cells that has been used to AST-VAC2 Vaccine which is now in clinical trials.","title":"AST-VAC2 Vaccine in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","url":"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03371485","members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAJtdhcB610t_h_oHibOnFQaqyLpbrGLYB8,NAME_SEARCH,WaNI)"}],"startedOn":{"month":7,"year":2015}}],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Biotechnology Research","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2015},"degree":"Researcher","eduId":599998213,"schoolUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:4522","school":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:4522","fieldsOfStudy":["Oncology and Cancer Biology"],"schoolName":"University of Cambridge","startedOn":{"year":2014}},{"endedOn":{"year":2014},"degree":"Doctor of Philosophy -
