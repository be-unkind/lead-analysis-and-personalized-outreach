As a recent pharmacy school graduate, I understand the financial challenges that come with pursuing higher education in healthcare. That's why I've created a scholarship aimed at supporting deserving pharmacy school graduates with the costs associated with taking the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).\n\nThe NAPLEX, which includes both the application and examination fees totaling $720, is a crucial step in the journey to becoming a licensed pharmacist.\n\nThis scholarship holds immense importance to me. Having experienced financial hardships during my own time in pharmacy school, I know firsthand how overwhelming these expenses can be. I remember the struggle of having to rely on family, which was already stretched to its limit, to cover my NAPLEX fees. I wished desperately for support during that time, and now I want to be that support for others.\n\nThe funds raised for this scholarship will go directly towards covering the NAPLEX fees for pharmacy school graduates. By alleviating this financial burden, we can empower aspiring pharmacists to focus on their studies and confidently take the next steps in their careers.\n\nWhile I currently have resources to support one winner, I'm hopeful that with your generosity, we can raise enough funds to support more aspiring pharmacists in the future. I\u2019ve made a GoFundMe to accept donations: https:\/\/gofund.me\/9d248b20 \n\nThe scholarship winners will be announced on May 10th, and I'm incredibly excited to see the positive impact this support will have on their journey.\n\nThank you for considering supporting this important cause. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of pharmacy school graduates and help them pursue their dreams without the weight of financial strain."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7186158811659816960"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7192569213536903168"}}},{"createdAt":1714150740000,"insightId":"ab954d7b-a0a8-4c98-a2fa-4d8f656f30c8","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":12},{"type":"PRAISE","count":4},{"type":"INTEREST","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7189669548919345152","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7189669548919345152","reactionsCount":18,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7189669548382474241","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"So excited for this partnership!"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5610AQFnw0IWvy3EYA\/image-shrink_1280\/0\/1714144580221?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=I_6Iw_EDmjjibm2WT53Jzld2QXg3sNDbhXvbMVbxvNM"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7189643465528348672","message":{"attributes":[{"length":25,"start":9,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:164901"}}},{"length":26,"start":312,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/rsh.md\/partnership"}}}],"text":"RUSH and MD Anderson Cancer Center announced today the creation of RUSH MD Anderson Cancer Center \u2014 redefining cancer care in the Chicago area.
