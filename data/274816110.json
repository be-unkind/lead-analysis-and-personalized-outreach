Yet, with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, accuracy can be lost for protein identification and quantification when using heterogeneous samples. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) allows for the enrichment of specific subsets of cells to study their proteome; however, sample fixation is necessary. Unfortunately, fixation hampers MS results due to protein cross\u2010linking. The aim of this study was to identify both a fixation protocol and an extraction method that returns the best yield of proteins for downstream MS analysis, while preserving cellular structures. We compared glutaraldehyde (GLU), a common fixative to preserve cells, to dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP), a cleavable cross\u2010linker. Our DTBP fixation\/extraction protocol greatly increased the protein recovery. In fact, while 1000 GLU fixed cells returned only 159 unique protein hits, from 1464 unique peptides of 1994 unique collected spectra, 1000 DTBP fixed cells resulted in 567 unique collected protein hits, from 7542 unique peptides, of 10,401 unique collected spectra. That is, a 3.57\u2010fold increase in protein hits, 5.15\u2010fold increase in unique peptides, and a 5.22\u2010fold increase in unique collected spectra. Overall, the novel protocol introduced here allows for a very efficient protein recovery and good sample quality for MS after sample collection using LCM.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/pmic.201700294","name":"A Novel Cell Fixation Method that Greatly Enhances Protein Identification in Microproteomic Studies Using Laser Capture Microdissection and Mass Spectrometry","publisher":"Proteomics","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBhXG4B3teoIs8JXSvxSd77XJCOBPVM0HU,NAME_SEARCH,g2VZ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACCEZMABZxLa-k74JeJhDsyV1Z93ffHr4ZU,NAME_SEARCH,RXMb)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":26,"year":2018},"description":"Currently approved inhibitors of the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway represent a major advance for the treatment of lung cancers, yet they are ineffective in a majority of patients due to lack of pre-existing T cell reactivity. Here we show that a TLR9 agonist delivered by inhalation is able to prime T cell responses against poorly immunogenic lung tumors and to complement the effects of PD-1 blockade. Inhaled TLR9 agonist causes profound remodeling in tumor-bearing lungs, leading to formation of tertiary lymphoid structures adjacent to the tumors, CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumors, dendritic cell expansion and antibody production. Inhalation of TLR9 agonist also increased the pool of functional PD-1lowT-bethigh effector CD8+ T in tumor-bearing lungs. Effector CD8+ T cells generated by inhaled TLR9 agonist treatment were licensed by PD-1 blockade to become highly functional CTL, leading to a durable rejection of both lung tumors and tumor lesions outside the lungs. CD4+ T cells activated in response to inhaled TLR9 play a critical role in this process by controlling the proliferation, preventing exhaustion, and guiding the differentiation of optimally functional CTL. This study characterizes a strategy to apply localized TLR9 stimulation to a tumor type not accessible for direct injection, a strategy that may expand the therapeutic potential of PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.","url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2018\/06\/26\/0008-5472.CAN-18-0729","name":"Inhaled TLR9 Agonist Renders Lung Tumors Permissive to PD-1 Blockade by Promoting Optimal CD4+ and CD8+ T cell Interplay","publisher":"Cancer Research","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBhXG4B3teoIs8JXSvxSd77XJCOBPVM0HU,NAME_SEARCH,g2VZ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlaCgcBDKXGqjPrW7GP6mDjX8-ARCieVWg,NAME_SEARCH,KTuZ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvI5DgBahnhZVXLq9pvSnrqyK0vIR-IdCk,NAME_SEARCH,w7pa)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADhpcABnOY7YWS0xcad67DdegEXvKY0YkU,NAME_SEARCH,d4HH)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"year":2019},"description":"Cell\u2013cell communication is vital to multicellular organisms, and distinct types of cellular protrusions play critical roles during development, cell signaling, and the spreading of pathogens and cancer. The differences in the structure and protein composition of these different types of protrusions and their specific functions have not been elucidated due to the lack of a method for their specific isolation and analysis. In this paper, we described, for the first time, a method to specifically isolate distinct protrusion subtypes, based on their morphological structures or fluorescent markers, using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Combined with a unique fixation and protein extraction protocol, we pushed the limits of microproteomics and demonstrate that proteins from LCM-isolated protrusions can successfully and reproducibly be identified by mass spectrometry using ultra-high field Orbitrap technologies. Our method confirmed that different types of protrusions have distinct proteomes and it promises to advance the characterization and the understanding of these unique structures to shed light on their possible role in health and disease.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/20\/5\/1172","name":"A novel microproteomic approach using Laser Capture microdissection to study cellular protrusions.","publisher":"International Journal of Molecular science","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBhXG4B3teoIs8JXSvxSd77XJCOBPVM0HU,NAME_SEARCH,g2VZ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACCEZMABZxLa-k74JeJhDsyV1Z93ffHr4ZU,NAME_SEARCH,RXMb)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":6,"day":26,"year":2023},"description":"The  increasing  use  of  nuclear  energy  sources  inevitably  raises  the  risk  of  accidental  or  deliberate radiation exposure and associated immune dysfunction. However, the extent to which radiation exposure impacts memory CD8 T cells, potent mediators of immunity to recurring intracellular infections and malignancies, remains understudied. Using P14 CD8 T cell chimeric mice (P14 chimeras) with an lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model, we observed that sublethal (5Gy) whole- body irradiation (WBI) induced a rapid decline in the number of naive (TN) and P14 circulating memory CD8 T cells (TCIRCM), with the former being more susceptible to radiation- induced numeric loss. While TN cell numbers rapidly recovered, as previously described, the number of P14 TCIRCM cells remained low at least 9 mo after radiation exposure. Additionally, the remain-ing P14 TCIRCM in irradiated hosts exhibited an inefficient transition to a central memory (CD62L+)  phenotype  compared  to  nonirradiated  P14  chimeras.  WBI  also  resulted  in  long- lasting T cell intrinsic deficits in memory CD8 T cells, including diminished cytokine and chemokine production along with impaired secondary expansion upon cognate Ag reencounter. Irradiated P14 chimeras displayed significantly higher bacterial burden after challenge with Listeria monocytogenes expressing the LCMV GP33- 41 epitope relative to nonirradiated controls, likely due to radiation- induced numerical and functional impair-ments. Taken together, our findings suggest that sublethal radiation exposure caused a long- term numerical, impaired differentiation, and functional dysregulation in preexisting TCIRCM, rendering previously protected hosts susceptible to reinfection.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.2302785120","name":"Sublethal whole-body irradiation induces permanent loss and dysfunction in pathogen-specific circulating memory CD8 T cell populations","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABBhXG4B3teoIs8JXSvxSd77XJCOBPVM0HU,NAME_SEARCH,g2VZ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABovhQYBakiqVFbdtgiMoSsEIAEJPeI3onw,NAME_SEARCH,IVJC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA34dIYBG5djKG_BIBEo_vQ60pcb08roavE,NAME_SEARCH,MN09)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":3,"day":4,"year":2024},"description":"Human sepsis is a complex disease that manifests with a diverse range of phenotypes and inherent variability among individuals, making it hard to develop a comprehensive animal model. Despite this difficulty, numerous models have been developed that capture many key aspects of human sepsis. The robustness of these models is vital for conducting pre-clinical studies to test and develop potential therapeutics. In this article, we describe four different models of murine sepsis that can be used to address different scientific questions relevant to the pathology and immune response during and after a septic event. Basic Protocol 1 details a non-synchronous cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis, where mice are subjected to polymicrobial exposure through surgery at different time points within 2 weeks. This variation in sepsis onset establishes each mouse at a different state of inflammation and cytokine levels that mimics the variability observed in humans when they present in the clinic. This model is ideal for studying the long-term impact of sepsis on the host. Basic Protocol 2 is also a type of polymicrobial sepsis, where injection of a specific amount of cecal slurry from a donor mouse into the peritoneum of recipient mice establishes immediate inflammation and sepsis without any need for surgery. Basic Protocol 3 describes infecting mice with a defined gram-positive or -negative bacterial strain to model a subset of sepsis observed in humans infected with a single pathogen. Basic Protocol 4 describes administering LPS to induce sterile endotoxemia. This form of sepsis is observed in humans exposed to bacterial toxins from the environment. \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
