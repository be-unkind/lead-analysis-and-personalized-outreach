The co-founders had been working under the tuition of Prof. Jeff Pearson, an expert in molecular physiology,\u00a0 mucus , pepsin and gastroeosophageal reflux, who is now the firm's chief science officer. \"We\u2019ve used our somewhat niche insights into mucus to create a model that finally bridges the gap between basic in vitro research and human trials,\" Dr. Matt Wilcox, COO at Aelius Biotech, explained. In addition to digestion, dissolution, absorption rate, mucus permeation and bioavailability, the model can analyze a product or ingredient\u2019s toxicity, enzymatic activity, carbohydrates, proteomics, amino acids, sugars and fatty acids. \"Our model can be scaled up or down,\" Dr. Wilcox added. \"If the client wants to look at their formulation with a specific ingredient, then we can look at that in detail or they can test a final formulation with or without meals\u2014comparing fed and fasted state responses.\u201d\u00a0 Dr. Wilcox noted that Aelius Biotech's unique capability to simulate enzymatic and chemical digestion from the mouth to the small intestine was used to support baked goods brand Modern Baker to assess the impact of its bread samples on glucose release. This helped the firm to optimize a proprietary blend of active healthy fibers to reduce glycemic response.\u00a0 \u201cWe showed their fibre formulation enhanced the nutritional profile of their product to significantly reduce the glucose spike,\u201d Dr. Wilcox said. The team can also work with clients to design and run human trials, such as the recent pilot study for Huel , in which 30 participants consumed \u00a0Huel powder exclusively for four weeks to discover the health impact of the product. Analyses included blood sampling, body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue and body composition testing Some of the noted health improvements during the trial included: decreased body weight, fat mass and BMI; improved blood glucose markers, improved cholesterol status; increased vitamin D, B12, iron and selenium; and alignment of potassium and vitamins A and E to RDA range. The firm raised \u00a31.25 million via Mercia Ventures at the end of 2023, which the team is now using to scale up its service for the food and pharma industries. \"There is increasing demand for\u00a0laboratory testing services but companies are trying to move away from the use of animals,\" Chris McCourt of Mercia Ventures, said at the time. \"Aelius\u2019s model is the most advanced of its type in the world and allows customers to determine the likely success of their products in a faster, more cost-effective and more ethical way.\"","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.nutraingredients.com\/News\/Markets-and-Trends\/Scientists-scale-up-world-s-first-in-vitro-gut-model-with-mucus-barrier?","title":"Scientists scale up world's first in vitro gut model with mucus barrier","sourceDomain":"nutraingredients.com"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7192150530884841472","message":{"attributes":[{"start":10,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:12672829"}}},{"start":294,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:411287156"}}},{"start":315,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eQpJ-ntc"}}}],"text":"Check out NutraIngredients latest article spotlighting our in vitro gastrointestinal models integrating the digestive, mucus, and epithelial barriers.
