{"summary":"I am currently a Bioengineering PhD student working in Arjun Raj's lab at the University of Pennsylvania. My primary interests are genetics and immunology, but I'm excited about any field with intricate systems that can be explored in new, groundbreaking ways. I am also an active member of the Penn Science Policy and Diplomacy Group, where we design and host events to educate graduate students on the intersection of their work in STEM with government and how they can use their scientific background to influence policy.","lastName":"Arnett","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:681942808","geoRegion":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States","fullName":"Miles Arnett","firstName":"Miles","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"University of Pennsylvania","title":"PHD Student","tenureAtCompany":{"numYears":1,"numMonths":10},"companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"10001+","headquarters":{"geographicArea":"PA","country":"United States","city":"Philadelphia","postalCode":"19104-6303","line1":"3451 Walnut Street"},"website":"http:\/\/www.upenn.edu\/","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/university-of-pennsylvania\/","industry":"Higher Education"},"startedOn":{"month":8,"year":2022},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:3165"}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACilnxgBe4YPB5RGRhcd5epoiO6PMd1e1F0,NAME_SEARCH,HV2L)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1631111842871?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=MVuIMtd69ftxrsrgXnGp0q08QVrOf2jZXhXdToejRJA","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1631111842871?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=3Q3OP_QHHYiVo9JNR0AIoFvFOsRmk71JG3AFYvcE10E","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1631111842871?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=OaYVVOoreX70GEFmzEbLKNf08sG20bjt_urv-9tCQEc","height":400},{"width":654,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1631111842871?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=IBy4QMXRbjCmollE9PJUihCHhFoi98n_pyiyyBHOTBw","height":654}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C5603AQHmxvI8KUiEig\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Biotechnology Research","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2022},"degree":"Bachelor of Science - BS","eduId":552903830,"schoolUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:157341","school":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:157341","fieldsOfStudy":["Biomedical\/Medical Engineering"],"schoolName":"Tufts University","startedOn":{"year":2018}},{"endedOn":{"year":2017},"degree":"Dual Enrollment","eduId":639600505,"schoolUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:7814","school":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:7814","schoolName":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","startedOn":{"year":2016}}],"skills":[{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Microsoft Office"},{"numOfEndorsement":2,"name":"Research"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Public Speaking"},{"numOfEndorsement":2,"name":"Leadership"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"C++"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Arduino"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Robotics"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Education"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Cell Culture"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Flow Cytometry"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Western Blotting"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Diversity & Inclusion"}],"pronoun":"He\/Him","numOfConnections":577,"patents":[],"headline":"Bioengineering PhD Student at UPenn","courses":[{"name":"Differential Equations"},{"name":"Principles of Controlled Release and Drug Formulation"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry"},{"name":"Molecular Biotechnology"},{"name":"Genetics"},{"name":"Quantitative Physiology"},{"name":"Data Structures"},{"name":"Algorithms"},{"name":"Cell Biology"},{"name":"Scientific Reading, Writing, and Presentation"}],"certifications":[{"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:1337","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/learning\/certificates\/c134344876f569dcf819e9239422a58fee188009b6ebb63e890eecbc78b71202","authority":"LinkedIn","name":"Confronting Bias: Thriving Across Our Differences","company":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:1337","startedOn":{"month":3,"year":2023}}],"memberBadges":{"premium":false,"openLink":false,"jobSeeker":false},"flagshipProfileUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/miles-arnett-9b446a170","organizations":[{"name":"Tau Beta Pi","description":"Tau Beta Pi is the oldest national engineering honor's society.
