Initial exposure of osteoblasts to carcinogenic doses of IR in vitro and in vivo induced RB1-dependent senescence and the expression of a panel of proteins known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), dominated by IL-6. RB1 expression closely correlated with that of the SASP cassette in human osteosarcomas, and low expression of both RB1 and the SASP genes was associated with poor prognosis. In vivo, IL-6 was required for IR-induced senescence, which elicited NKT cell infiltration and a host inflammatory response. Mice lacking IL-6 or NKT cells had accelerated development of IR-induced osteosarcomas. These data elucidate an important link between senescence, which is a cell-autonomous tumor suppressor response, and the activation of host-dependent cancer immunosurveillance. Our findings indicate that overcoming the immune response to senescence is a rate-limiting step in the formation of IR-induced osteosarcoma.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24231354","name":"Immune response to RB1-regulated senescence limits radiation-induced osteosarcoma formation.","publisher":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAD-N5cBZGPRRi4D2sd1HAuXr2rJXLYWvqU,NAME_SEARCH,_V_2)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"year":2013},"description":"Sarcomas are a key feature of Li-Fraumeni and related syndromes (LFS\/LFL), associated with germline TP53 mutations.

In patients with soft tissue sarcoma and the patients with inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer, local recurrence is common and significant mortality is caused by the subsequent emergence of metastatic disease. Thus, although the aim of the primary therapy is curative, the outcome may be improved by additional targeting of residual microscopic disease. We display in a murine model that surgical removal of a large primary sarcoma results in local recurrence in approximately 50% of animals. Depletion of CD8 T cells results in local recurrence in 100% of animals, indicating that these cells are involved in the control of residual disease. We further show that systemic adjuvant administration of \u03b1OX40 at surgery eliminates local recurrences. In this model, \u03b1OX40 acts to directly enhance tumor antigen-specific CD8 T-cell proliferation in the lymph node draining the surgical site, and results in increased tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity in vivo. These results are also corroborated in a murine model of hypofractionated radiation therapy of lung cancer. Administration of \u03b1OX40 in combination with radiation significantly extended the survival compared with either agent alone, and resulted in a significant proportion of long-term tumor-free survivors.

Sufficient amounts of RNA needed for screening studies and early-stage clinical trials cannot be produced from traditional small-scale reactions performed in the laboratory. Larger scale reactions, with RNA yields linearly scaling with reaction volume, are necessary to produce the substantial amounts of RNA required to meet the demands of these studies. As the use of RNA as a therapeutic becomes more widespread, challenges arise for scientists to produce high-quality RNA at the significant scale required to meet the demands of vaccine production, early-stage characterization and other investigations. Cost-effectiveness, as well as minimal optimization and troubleshooting, are key considerations when scaling in vitro transcription (IVT) workflows. RNA yields should scale linearly as input and reaction volumes increase, an objective that is not always straightforward. Larger volume reaction vessels require optimized protocols, and precautions should be taken to ensure proper mixing and consistent temperature throughout the reaction vessel in order to maintain the abundant yields and quality of RNA that is expected. These challenges compound as volumes of reactions increase; therefore we have tested the scalability of (IVT) reactions utilizing New\u00a0England Biolabs (NEB) enzymes and kits to provide a generalized set of recommendations for synthesizing high yields of RNA, of various lengths and sequence compositions, from bench to commercial scale. This technical note includes a set of recommendations to facilitate the scaling of workflows utilizing both the HiScribe\u00ae line of T7 and SP6 RNA Polymerase-based in vitro transcription kits, as well as individual enzymes (T7 RNA Polymerase, Inorganic Pyrophosphatase (E. coli) and RNase Inhibitor, Murine), which are available from NEB as research use only (RUO) and GMP- grade*\u00a0products. IVT Template Strategies Successful in vitro transcription reactions are achieved by starting with high-quality input materials. First, a source of linear, double- stranded DNA (dsDNA) template that includes the T7 promoter (or other promoter sequence if using an alternative phage DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) upstream of the sequence of interest is required. T7 RNA Polymerase recognizes and binds to the T7 promoter, transcribing in the 5\uf7b4 \u2192 3\uf7b4 direction and falling off the end of the linear template, releasing the run-off transcript. To generate dsDNA templates for IVT, two common strategies that are frequently employed are linearization of a plasmid downstream of the sequence of interest using restriction enzymes (leaving a blunt end or 5\uf7b4 end overhang) or PCR amplification of a sequence of interest by utilizing high-fidelity DNA polymerases. Introduction of promoter sequences on a forward primer can be achieved through PCR, creating a complete dsDNA template. It is important that these templates are free from contaminants that can be introduced through purification steps and subsequently may inhibit the IVT process. If in- house means of generating the large amount of dsDNA required when scaling RNA synthesis is beyond capacity, outsourcing this step can be an option. However, extra planning may be required to keep projects on task and secure a supply as the time to go from plasmid expression to purified linearized DNA at scale can be a lengthy process that may be in high demand and may subsequently impact timelines. RNA Synthesis Formats With template design in place, in vitro transcription format selection is the next step in the process. NEB offers several options for RNA synthesis, including the highly optimized, high yield HiScribe IVT transcription kits, as well as standalone enzymes and reagents, which includes RNA polymerases, nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), inorganic pyrophosphatases, RNase inhibitors and reaction buffers (Table 1, page 2). In the following set of recommendations, features of both strategies will be highlighted. RNA synthesis in the moderate range, (up to 20 ml), can be performed with easily accessible equipment and consumables, while larger scale reactions may require more sophisticated equipment that is designed to maintain consistent temperatures throughout the vessel as well as a means for gently mixing the reactions throughout the incubation.

Alternatively, incubation in a water bath or thermomixer can also be considered, as comparable yields were achieved (Figure\u00a02). Whichever method is selected, it is imperative that the temperature remains consistent, and the reactions are gently mixed during incubation. Pilot IVT Reaction Length, Template Amount and Template Purity When preparing to scale IVT reactions, we would recommend testing conditions (e.g., reaction length, template amount, template purity) at a small-scale (20 \u2013 100 \u00b5l) before scaling up to ensure conditions are optimized to achieve the highest yields. In general, transcripts that are shorter require a longer reaction incubation to allow for the highest yield (weight of RNA), as more RNA polymerase initiation events need to occur to reach the same weight of RNA compared to a longer RNA. A time course is an excellent way to determine the reaction length where maximum amount of RNA is synthesized, which may be different depending on transcript length (Figure\u00a03). Selection of a reaction length that achieves high yield will also limit exposure of the RNA to conditions that might lead to degradation during extended incubations, especially with longer RNAs REACTION SETUP When setting up IVT reactions, there are a few key considerations at the onset to ensure the highest yield possible. A trusted source of nuclease-free water is important \u2014 DEPC-treated water is not recommended as it is not necessary and the presence of any byproducts that remain may inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions. However, we do recommend taking precautions such as wearing gloves, using filtered tips, and working in a dedicated RNase-free area to reduce the chances of RNase contamination. When gathering the necessary enzymes and reagents, it is important to thaw the buffers, NTPs and templates to room temperature while keeping the enzyme(s) on ice. Next, thorough mixing of the buffer and NTPs is important as components tend to settle to the bottom of the tubes after thawing. The order of addition for the IVT reaction is also important and should follow the order listed in the manual, with enzyme added last. Gentle mixing of the reaction, with care taken to avoid bubble formation, is key to successful synthesis. Gentle mixing during incubation, two to three times, should be performed to achieve the highest yield possible (Figure\u00a01). Gentle inversion of the tube five to six times is sufficient. The IVT reactions performed in this paper were incubated in Eppendorf Protein LoBind\u00ae tubes (1.5 ml snap cap (#022431081), 5 ml screw cap (#0030122356), 15 ml screw cap (#0030122216) or 50 ml screw cap FIGURE 2: Various incubation methods result in comparable RNA Yields for small-scale in vitro transcription HiScribe reactions were scaled to 1 ml in protein LoBind tubes using the CLuc control template and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in a dry air incubator, a thermomixer, or a water bath.

RNA lengths are A (300 bp), B (1.76 kb), C (5 kb) and D (9 kb). RNA A requires a 2-hour incubation to reach maximum yields, whereas longer RNAs require approximately 1 hour. FIGURE 3: Shorter RNAs require longer incubation times to reach maximum RNA yields. 4 An additional factor to keep in mind is the amount of input template required to reach the highest yield possible for a reaction length that limits accumulation of byproducts. This will need to be established not only for the length of the transcript, but by the type of template. As recommendations for input template are by weight (\u00b5g), comparing PCR-generated templates Reaction length may need to be determined for each RNA to be synthesized, but once this is established at the small-scale, high yields can be achieved at larger volumes when all reaction components are scaled linearly (Figure\u00a04). Comparison of incubation time for a 300\u00a0nucleotide (nt) RNA demonstrates that optimal reaction length determined in a standard small-scale reaction translates to large scale and yields can be achieved that are comparable to the scaled calculated prediction of the control template provided in the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB#\u00a0E2040). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 2 4 6 8 10 R N A Y ie ld ( m g) Reaction Volume (ml) CLuc (2 hr.) pRNA300 (1 hr.) pRNA300 (4 hr.)

Reactions were incubated in a dry air incubator in protein LoBind tubes. CLuc is 1.76 kb and pRNA300 is 300 bp. Cluc reactions were incubated for 2 hours (blue), pRNA300 was incubated for 1\u00a0(yellow) or 4 (gold) hours.

For long RNAs, the associated input template is also long and therefore fewer moles of that template (and promoter) exist compared to a shorter RNA or shorter PCR template that does not contain the extra plasmid sequence required for plasmid propagation. A simple template titration in a small-scale reaction will aid in the determination of the best amount of template to reach highest yields in the reaction time selected (Figure 5). As mentioned above, template amount and reaction length are vital to guarantee that the highest yields can be reached. It is also of great importance that the dsDNA template is pure and free from any carryover salts, proteins or impurities that may interfere with transcription and result in low yields. Finally, if the plasmid is not completely linearized, transcripts of the wrong size may be generated as the polymerase will not have a defined end to fall off of for run- off transcription. Performing small-scale IVTs will identify any issue with the template before scaling up which will save time and reagents.

In vitro transcription reactions (HiScribe, 100 \u00b5l reactions) with dsDNA template titrations (2 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g, 0.5 \u00b5g) were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C with either CLuc (1.76 kb) or a 5 kb template. A. CLuc (1.76 kb) reached maximum RNA yields by 1 hour with either 1 or 2 \u00b5g dsDNA template and maximum yield by 120 minutes. B. 5 kb template reaction reached maximum yield by 1 hour (2 \u00b5g template) or 2 hours (1 \u00b5g template) but only reached ~80% maximum yield by 2 hours with 0.5 \u00b5g template input. Optimization with HiScribe Kits and Standalone Enzymes The NEB HiScribe in vitro transcription kits are extensively optimized to work with a broad range of RNA lengths, sequences and inputs, resulting in reproducible yields of RNA. Standalone enzymes are also available (RNA polymerases, inorganic pyrophosphatases, NTPs and RNase inhibitors) for IVT workflows when it is desired to optimize reaction conditions and components for individual sequences. Kit components and individual enzymes are offered at RUO and GMP-\u00a0grade as indicated in Table 1, page 2. T7 RNA Polymerase is the most widely used RNA Polymerase for IVT workflows. NEB offers T7 RNA Polymerase at 50,000 U\/ml (RUO and GMP-grade), 250,000 U\/ml (GMP-grade) and 1,000,000 U\/ml (RUO-grade). In order to determine the appropriate units of T7 RNA Polymerase needed for transcription with a certain concentration of NTPs, an enzyme titration should be performed. In Figure 6 (page 5), we show titration of T7 RNA Polymerase with 5 mM each NTP in a small-scale reaction. 5 For 5 mM NTPs, 100 units of T7 RNA Polymerase (5 U\/\u00a0\u00b5l final in the reaction) is suitable for transcription of the control template (Figure 6A). In addition to enzyme titration, the sufficient amount of magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ) should also be determined, being careful to avoid concentrations of MgCl 2 that are too high and may induce metal- dependent degradation of RNA at elevated temperatures over time. A similar titration of Inorganic Pyrophosphatase (E. coli) was performed at small-scale, and 0.1 units (0.005 U\/\u00b5l final) with 20 units of RNase Inhibitor (1 U\/\u00b5l final) was shown to produce vast quantities of RNA and is scalable (Figure 6B). Keep in mind that the enzyme concentrations may need to be titrated based on sequence and RNA length, while keeping final glycerol concentration low, but these general guidelines provide an excellent foundation. Using high concentration enzymes, when possible, can help reduce final glycerol concentration. Once these parameters are in place, linear scaling of the reaction can be performed to synthesize the amount of RNA required for individual workflows. Higher yield and more convenient reaction setup can be achieved using our HiScribe kits. While these kits are available through our catalog, we can also provide bulk and GMP-grade reaction components for large- scale therapeutic manufacturing. However, as mentioned above, high-yield reactions using higher concentration enzymes to ensure low final glycerol concentration are possible. Here, yields of standard HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Transcription Kit (NEB #E2040) reactions were compared to IVT reactions utilizing standalone T7 RNA Polymerase titrated in the presence of Inorganic Pyrophosphatase (E. coli) and RNase Inhibitor (Murine). All reactions contained 10\u00a0mM each NTP; HiScribe IVT reactions had slightly higher yields (Figure 7) even though T7 RNA Polymerase was present at the same concentration (1X).

A minimum of 100 units of T7 RNA Polymerase is required to transcribe ~100 \u00b5g of CLuc RNA. B. Reaction conditions scaled linearly from 20 \u00b5l to 10 ml results in linear RNA yields.

Reactions (100 \u00b5l, 10 mM each NTP) were set up following a linearly scaled HiScribe format (expected yield = 900 \u00b5g) and compared to reactions with individual enzymes (T7 RNA Polymerase, Inorganic Pyrophosphatase, and Murine RNase Inhibitor). Reactions with individual enzymes were set up with comparable concentration of T7 RNA Polymerase concentration in HiScribe format (1X), or a titration of T7 RNA Polymerase (0.7X and 0.4X) to determine the concentration of T7 RNA Polymerase required for maximum yield. 6 While the performance of both HiScribe kits and standalone enzymes result in high yields of RNA, it is important to know if these yields are consistent among different lots of the same enzymes. To determine this, three separate lots of T7 RNA Polymerase (50,000 U\/ml) were used in IVT reactions scaling 50-fold under identical reaction conditions and linear yields were nearly identical (Figure 8A). In addition, time course experiments were carried out with multiple lots of the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Transcription Kit (NEB \u00a0#E2040), and the rates of the reactions were nearly identical (Figure 8B). Finally, taking all the knowledge gained on input template amount, optimization and incubation time, reactions were scaled 1000- fold up to 20\u00a0ml following HiScribe protocols (Figure 9A) or workflows described above utilizing standalone enzymes (Figures 9B and C) and linearized dsDNA to transcribe longer RNAs (5 kb and 9\u00a0kb). When all components were scaled linearly, including templates, yields were as expected (Figure 9A) when projecting predicted small-scale yields 1000-fold with reaction volume increase. Together, these experiments demonstrate that IVT synthesis using NEB's HiScribe kits or standalone enzymes offer scalable, robust and consistent RNA synthesis, Further, this data was consistent across many manufacturing lots.

And finally, RNA purification to remove proteins, reaction byproducts and dsRNA that may trigger an immune response should be kept in mind and methods exist to column-purify single-stranded RNAs of the correct length. The emergence of RNA as a therapeutic necessitates the need for larger scale production and synthesis workflows. We hope that the recommendations presented in this study can provide a framework for IVT scale up for customers interested in generating large quantities of high quality RNAs using consistent and robust reagents. NEB fully supports mRNA synthesis with a suite of tools to take you from template to transcript. CONCLUSION Here we have presented a set of recommendations for scaling of in vitro RNA synthesis reactions for production of RNA of various sizes using both HiScribe in vitro transcription kits and individual enzymes (T7 RNA Polymerase, Inorganic Pyrophosphatase (E. coli) and RNase Inhibitor, Murine), all of which are manufactured by NEB both as research use only (RUO-grade) and GMP- grade products. The experiments described in this paper provide a foundation for scaling IVT reactions to synthesize RNAs of various lengths, sequences and structures using equipment and consumables that are readily accessible. Scaling to even higher reaction volumes will need further planning and specialized equipment, such as bioreactors. Additionally, maintaining a consistent temperature and gentle mixing in the reaction vessel will be key to achieving optimal RNA yields in larger volume reactions. Pre- warming of reaction components was tested at the reaction scales mentioned in this paper and it did not change efficiency or yields, but it will likely be an important factor to consider when scaling up. Finally, to increase RNA stability and generate fully functional mRNAs capable of recognition by the cellular translational machinery, additional steps will need to be taken to incorporate a 5\uf7b4 cap structure and poly(A) tail. Several strategies exist for poly(A) tailing, either post-transcriptionally through addition by Poly(A) Polymerase or encoded in the dsDNA template. Additionally, numerous methods of adding a 5\uf7b4 cap to the RNA can be considered, including co-transcriptional capping (ARCA, CleanCap\u00ae Reagent AG) or post-transcriptional capping using Faustovirus Capping Enzyme (FCE) or Vaccinia Capping Enzyme (VCE) and Cap 2\uf7b4-O-Methyl Transferase. In addition, modifications to the methods described above also include incorporation of modified nucleotides to decrease immune response.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/en-au\/-\/media\/nebus\/files\/application-notes\/scaling_of_high_yield_in_vitro_transcription_reactions_for_linear_increase_of_rna_production.pdf?rev=6b298209b94b45a6a0532c86c14b5cf5&sc_lang=en-au","title":"Scaling of High-Yield In vitro Transcription Reactions for Linear Increase of RNA Production","sourceDomain":"neb.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":8},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":2}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194182959032160256","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194182959032160256","reactionsCount":10,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194182957807423489","message":{"attributes":[{"start":435,"length":19,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:26482"}}},{"start":810,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e7sFU3Pj"}}}],"text":"\nSometimes we have to go slow, to go fast.\nThe details matters.\n\nPressures of meeting milestones, getting experiments to just work, publications etc sometimes can shuttle \"nice to know\" to the bottom of our list.\n\nThat \"nice to know\" can be really important, especially when it can impact efficiency, quality and resources  from a holistic perspective.\n\nThis is definitely the case in regards to scaling up of IVT for mRNA production.
