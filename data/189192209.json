Because of its silence and quietness, the audiences were forced to focus on the nonverbal signs in the movie. The theme of this movie was family values. One of many important films is mise \u2013en-scene as this communicates indirectly to the audiences. The aim of this study was to know how the theme \u201cFamily Values\u201d was visualized in the movie. Using qualitative approach and Semiotics analysis method, this study focused on how the signs and mise-en-scene in the film were interpreted based on the researchers\u2019 interpretation using Metz\u2019 Grand Syntagmatique (1974). This study was a desk research and the data were obtained from selected scenes of the movie. The results showed that there were five syntagma category used in the film; i.e. autonomous shot, episodic sequence, scene, alternate syntagma, and descriptive syntagma.

This was done with the hope that after seeing the pictures they became afraid and then voluntarily stopped their smoking. The smoking habits referred to here include smoking behavior, smoking motivation, knowledge of the adverse effects of smoking, perceptions of smokers about cigarettes and smokers' efforts to protect themselves from the dangers of smoking among residents in Cikupa Bagus Residence (CBR). Cikupa Bagus Residence is in Talaga Sari Village, Cikupa District. In this residence there are around 58 families, most of them residents work as factory employees who are around this housing. The majority are migrants from outside the area who left their hometown to find work and good income in urban areas. Based on information from Cikupa Community Health Center employees, the clean and healthy lifestyle (PHBS) movement is associated with efforts to eliminate smoking habits of the community members. But this effort is like \"enforcing a wet yarn\" very difficult to realize. Never mind\neliminating, to make smokers aware that reducing smoking habits is very difficult. Awareness of smokers to stop smoking is a difficult problem to realize, considering that many people from various walks of life have these habits. It is difficult to find role models that can be invited to, support the movement to stop smoking in this environment. Smokers have a \"false\" belief that even if they smoke, they believe they can live a healthy life. For them this kind of illness only happens to other people, and it won't happen to them. This research uses a quantitative method with a random sampling approach. Data were collected using open questionnaires and structured official interviews, while data analysis was carried out with quantitative descriptive analysis.","url":"http:\/\/lspr.edu\/lppm\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Eprociding-KNP2K-2019-1-1.pdf","name":"Pengaruh Gambar Menyeramkan Pada Bungkus Rokok Terhadap Kebiasaan Merokok Warga Perumahan Cikupa Bagus Residence","publisher":"PROSIDING KNP2K 2019 LSPR - Jakarta Konferensi Nasional Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat bidang Komunikasi","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAtG2BEBFuPyTEWwDc_dW29HPCUjfaAgO7I,NAME_SEARCH,X_54)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":10,"year":2020},"description":"Background: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) on current MRI cochlear examination able to support the diagnosis and help determine implantation therapy.

ASL should be used as an additional protocol in brain examinations because it allows radiologists to assess the significance of CBF values using a quantitative method that is more reliable and non-invasive.","url":"https:\/\/medic.upm.edu.my\/upload\/dokumen\/2023091816563052_MJMHS_0978.pdf","name":"Case Report: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Contribution for Clinical Implementation of Brain Disease","publisher":"Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAtG2BEBFuPyTEWwDc_dW29HPCUjfaAgO7I,NAME_SEARCH,X_54)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADYK--EBMnwMAcQbGs789qBBNpCgBOSBD-8,NAME_SEARCH,K7LI)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":31,"year":2024},"description":"This research aims to analyses the two-ways communication process between trainers and participants during MRI training in various hospitals in Indonesia, considering the different cultural backgrounds of the individual involved.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/377964764_Implementation_of_Coordinated_Management_of_Meaning_Theory_in_Intercultural_Communication_between_Trainers_Participants_during_MRI_Training","name":"Implementation of Coordinated Management of Meaning Theory in Intercultural Communication between Trainers & Participants during MRI Training","publisher":"Proceeding Book The International Conference on Communication and Business (ICCB)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAtG2BEBFuPyTEWwDc_dW29HPCUjfaAgO7I,NAME_SEARCH,X_54)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_tq00BazWO8XM8VHaQHxYBH02V6LkRspU,NAME_SEARCH,lWqw)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHmaKgBgDTYqhgvNRdr0MJ0ii33dcy01nM,NAME_SEARCH,eTj8)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715101260000,"insightId":"9f26a22e-aeb2-45db-99ea-5358be5e85c9","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQGFXkLqjOATPA\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715101281583?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=qIGZYm_obzYOpQDPBXNJAGP6zjkar_dD4g1scqs1JmI"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":42},{"type":"PRAISE","count":2},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7193656171919007745","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7193656171919007745","reactionsCount":45,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7193656170765500416","message":{"attributes":[{"start":404,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:135340588"}}},{"start":418,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:1160586067"}}},{"start":435,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:466324634"}}},{"start":448,"length":15,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:597685776"}}},{"start":464,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:413675561"}}},{"start":481,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:781564992"}}},{"start":496,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:gemrlovers"}}},{"start":550,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1016"}}},{"start":577,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dGHzJ2FZ"}}},{"start":603,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1016"}}},{"start":617,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:261853570"}}},{"start":631,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:130473745"}}},{"start":643,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:150809930"}}},{"start":667,"length":11,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:31649699"}}},{"start":679,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:231608025"}}}],"text":"Creating scientific storytelling requires passion, consistency and persistence.
