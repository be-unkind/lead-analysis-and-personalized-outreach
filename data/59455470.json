{"summary":"I like working cross functionally in the early phases (I,  II) of biomedical technologies. I am driven by understanding biomedical problems from technical, basic physiological, clinical workflow and regulatory perspectives. All of my research projects have been at the intersection of electrically active system design, basic physiology (cardiac and briefly neuro), signal processing, prototype development, pre-clinical validation, and\/or scientific communication. \n\nBetween academia and industry, I have contributed towards problems related to electrophysiology, bio algorithms, bioelectronics, biosensors, and hypothesis driven validation activities. I have worked in in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo and acute lab settings.","lastName":"Shah","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:59455470","geoRegion":"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","fullName":"Ankur Shah","firstName":"Ankur","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"University of Utah","description":"\u25a0\tDriving translational R&D work related to characterization of requirements for cardiac conduction system CRT-P and CRT-D leads.","title":"Postdoctoral Research Associate","companyUrnResolutionResult":{"employeeCountRange":"10001+","headquarters":{"geographicArea":"ut","country":"United States","city":"Salt Lake City","postalCode":"84112-9008","line2":"Address 2","line1":"201 Presidents Circle, ROOM 203"},"website":"http:\/\/utah.edu","flagshipCompanyUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/university-of-utah\/","industry":"Higher Education"},"companyUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesCompany:15251168","tenureAtCompany":{"numMonths":10},"startedOn":{"month":8,"year":2023}}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOLN-4BsF1N0lptnQ1O7WNGeIctbCiiGb0,NAME_SEARCH,lVYo)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1614824844493?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=1ULgUQXLoCVw6DDm3wYPmMMtv0mkz_zliZrORQ2-niM","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1614824844493?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=fMEOeuHPltD3AxwHObdlx-nuGeURjb5m8P_23C34mm0","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1614824844493?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=Hay_8OlW61-IVtTEbfqtrTz3bWgvEl9r2FXb6YqLqRg","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1614824844493?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=tTyddoNkzx1nQrDfk7VsPJPXnbAK5RqG9ad7-otXm3g","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C5603AQHkTUgrCJGybw\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":12,"year":2013},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOLN-4BsF1N0lptnQ1O7WNGeIctbCiiGb0,NAME_SEARCH,lVYo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2SQmwBxqSO1viCE-PsCFS7JVtiEtyYzAQ,NAME_SEARCH,RcSB)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA83-ewBrw2p4r77VFQJNQxxiMP9PJC5wBY,NAME_SEARCH,OR1M)"}],"description":"Modeled the function of Human Superior Colliculus to classify events considering visual and auditory inputs in Matlab.","title":"Robotic vision using Bayers model","startedOn":{"month":12,"year":2013}},{"endedOn":{"month":12,"year":2013},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOLN-4BsF1N0lptnQ1O7WNGeIctbCiiGb0,NAME_SEARCH,lVYo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABKEaP4BQZ7NXviB48CWlyBbbI3g4QLBjdQ,NAME_SEARCH,sZkP)"}],"description":"Used MATLAB, VMTK, and Paraview to generate stress estimates when a stent model is inserted in the imaging reconstructed model blood vessel.","title":"Stress indicator heat-map for stents inside blood vessels using structures created from segmented images","startedOn":{"month":12,"year":2013}},{"endedOn":{"month":5,"year":2016},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAOLN-4BsF1N0lptnQ1O7WNGeIctbCiiGb0,NAME_SEARCH,lVYo)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABf-deQB3zGn_YLJZV8AohV6qr0YBtUUkTs,NAME_SEARCH,6Nn5)"}],"description":"Adopted 3 algorithms to discriminate speech signal vs. music signal without using any Matlab toolboxes.
