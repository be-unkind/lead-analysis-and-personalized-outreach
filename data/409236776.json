adenoma, although with different prevalence. Recently, activating mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX oncogenes were identified in benign parathyroid adenoma by whole exome sequencing. The same mutations had been found in blood and ovary malignant tumours. On one hand, this result raised the hypothesis that these oncogenes may play a role in the onset of parathyroid tumour, but it would also suggest they may be involved in malignant, rather benign, parathyroid neoplasm. Our aim was to verify the occurrence of selected mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX genes in an Italian cohort of 23 sporadic parathyroid carcinomas, 12 atypical and 45 typical adenomas. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, PCR amplified and directly sequenced. No mutations were detected in the coding sequence and boundaries of both genes in any of the samples. Two polymorphisms of the EZH2 gene were identified with different prevalence: the rs2072407 variant was present in the 30 % of the samples, in keeping with the overall frequency in larger populations, while the rs78589034 variant, located close to the 5' end of the exon 16, was detected in only one proband with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism; we investigated the possible outcome on the splicing process. EZH2 and ZFX genes do not seem to have an impact on the onset of most parathyroid tumours, both benign and malignant, though further studies on larger cohorts of different ethnicity are needed.","url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s12020-016-0892-y","name":"EZH2 and ZFX oncogenes in malignant behaviour of parathyroid neoplasms","publisher":"Endocrine","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAq0q58BrJcJQeP9uvVs7rjSAWzelFwfPMM,NAME_SEARCH,NLHp)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbTLooBZt856gGur1ZLJRzvZEt0QBre-Jg,NAME_SEARCH,YixS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":25,"year":2016},"description":"The transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2 related factor 2) is a master regulator of the cell antioxidant response associated with tumor growth and resistance to cytotoxic treatments. In particular, Nrf2 induces upregulation of cytoprotective genes by interacting with the closely situated AREs (Antioxidant Response Elements) in response to endogenous or exogenous stress stimuli and takes part to several oncogenic signaling pathways. Among these, the crosstalk with Notch pathway has been shown to enhance cytoprotection and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, tissue organization by modulating cell proliferation kinetics, and stem cell self-renewal in several organs. The role of Notch and Nrf2 related pathways in tumorigenesis is highly variable and when they are both abnormally activated they can synergistically cause neoplastic proliferation by promoting cell survival, differentiation, invasion, and metastases. NFE2L2, KEAP1, and NOTCH genes family appear in the list of significantly mutated genes in tumors in both combined and individual sets, supporting the crucial role that the aberrant Nrf2-Notch crosstalk might have in cancerogenesis.

This amazing bridge between growth factor receptors and cancer has been consolidated during the last decades through the identification of many driver mutations in the gene key of the RTKs network. Unexpected molecular lesions of the NRG1 gene followed by an aberrant ErbB signaling were recently described as a new molecular features of non-small cell lung cancer, but it has been also sporadically reported in other tumors. The NRG1 chimeric ligand leads to aberrant activation of the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers signaling pathways via PI3K-AKT and MAPK cascades in cancers of the breast, lung, brain, head and neck, and colon. Molecular lesions of the ErbB network and PI3K-AKT are well-investigated in lung cancer and actually represent one of the main interesting targets for the current pharmacological studies. However, new insights into this picture are strongly needed to increase its translational impact. We highlight the current knowledge about the ErbB network and NRG1 deregulation in lung cancer and their merger into the ErbB\/PI3K-AKT axis modulation and current therapeutic strategies. Several drugs targeting ErbB2, ErbB3 and their downstream pathways in different stages of clinical development are actually available.

Thus far, only 4 cases with homozygous and 2 cases with heterozygous mutations in the PTH gene have been reported.\nObjective\nTo clinically describe an FIH family and identify and characterize the causal gene mutation.\nDesign\nGenomic DNA of family members was subjected to CASR, GCM2, GNA11, and PTH gene mutational analysis. Functional assays were performed on the variant identified.\nParticipants\nSix subjects of a three-generation FIH family with 3 affected individuals having severe hypocalcemia and inappropriately low serum PTH.\nResults\nNo mutations were detected in the CASR, GCM2, and GNA11 genes. A novel heterozygous variant that segregated with the disease was identified in PTH gene exon 2 (c.41T>A; p.M14K). This missense variant, in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence, was predicted in silico to impair cleavage of preproPTH to proPTH. Functional assays in HEK293 cells demonstrated much higher retention intracellularly but impaired secretion into the medium of the M14K mutant relative to wildtype. Addition of the pharmacological chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid, led to a reduction of cellular retention and increased accumulation in the cell medium of the M14K mutant.\nConclusions\nWe report a novel heterozygous PTH mutation in an FIH family and demonstrate accumulation of the mutant intracellularly and its impaired secretion. An accurate genetic diagnosis in such hypoparathyroid patients is critical for appropriate management and genetic counseling.","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1210\/jc.2017-00250","name":"Novel Autosomal Dominant PTH Gene Signal Sequence Mutation in a Family with Familial Isolated Hypoparathyroidism.","publisher":"The journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"}]},{"name":"ALK and NRG1 Fusions Coexist in a Patient with Signet Ring Cell Lung Adenocarcinoma.","publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2017},"publisher":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jtho.2017.05.014","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAL7VskBO59SCOXSwYU1pTpvYalMSCG0WPA,NAME_SEARCH,N3B6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbTLooBZt856gGur1ZLJRzvZEt0QBre-Jg,NAME_SEARCH,YixS)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":8,"year":2017},"description":"La rapida evoluzione tecnologica e il progresso scientifico hanno reso la professione del Tecnico Sanitario di Laboratorio Biomedico (TSLB) sempre pi\u00f9 complessa e in continuo sviluppo; in quest\u2019ottica anche nelle selezioni dei concorsi pubblici sono richieste conoscenze sempre pi\u00f9 ampie.

The physical interaction between these two proteins promotes the expression of several antioxidant defense genes in response to exogenous and endogenous insults. Recent studies demonstrated that KEAP1\/NRF2 axis dysfunction is also strongly related to tumor progression and chemo- and radiotherapy resistance of cancer cells. In solid tumors, the KEAP1\/NRF2 system is constitutively activated by the loss of KEAP1 or gain of NFE2L2 functions that leads to its nuclear accumulation and enhances the transcription of many cytoprotective genes. In addition to point mutations, epigenetic abnormalities, as aberrant promoter methylation, and microRNA (miRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) deregulation were reported as emerging mechanisms of KEAP1\/NRF2 axis modulation. This review will summarize the current knowledge about the epigenetic mechanisms that deregulate the KEAP1\/NRF2 cascade in solid tumors and their potential usefulness as prognostic and predictive molecular markers.","url":"https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/omcl\/2018\/2492063\/","name":"Epigenetic versus Genetic Deregulation of the Keap1\/Nrf2 Axis in Solid Tumors: Focus on Methylation and Noncoding RNAs","publisher":"Oxid Med Cell Longev ","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAL7VskBO59SCOXSwYU1pTpvYalMSCG0WPA,NAME_SEARCH,N3B6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"name":"Gene Code CD274\/PD-L1: from molecular basis towards immunotherapy","publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":17,"year":2018},"publisher":"Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology","url":"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1758835918815598","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAL7VskBO59SCOXSwYU1pTpvYalMSCG0WPA,NAME_SEARCH,N3B6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":23,"year":2019},"description":"Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nThe KEAP1\/NRF2 pathway has been widely investigated in tumors since it was implicated in cancer cells survival and therapies resistance. In lung tumors the deregulation of this pathway is mainly related to point mutations of KEAP1 and NFE2L2 genes and KEAP1 promoter hypermethylation, but these two genes have been rarely investigated in low\/intermediate grade neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.\nMETHODS:\nThe effects of KEAP1 silencing on NRF2 activity was investigated in H720 and H727 carcinoid cell lines and results were compared with those obtained by molecular profiling of KEAP1 and NFE2L2 in a collection of 47 lung carcinoids. The correlation between methylation and transcript levels was assessed by 5-aza-dC treatment.\nRESULTS:\nWe demonstrated that in carcinoid cell lines, the KEAP1 silencing induces an upregulation of NRF2 and some of its targets and that there is a direct correlation between KEAP1 methylation and its mRNA levels. A KEAP1 hypermethylation and Loss of Heterozygosity at KEAP1 gene locus was also observed in nearly half of lung carcinoids.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis is the first study that has described the effects of KEAP1 silencing on the regulation of NRF2 activity in lung carcinoids cells.

The methylation status was assessed using quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) and pyrosequencing, and the performance of the two assays was compared.\nRESULTS:\nHypermethylation at the promoter region of the KEAP1 was detected in one third of cell lines and its effect on the modulation KEAP1 mRNA levels was also confirmed by in vitro 5-Azacytidine treatment on lung carcinoid, small lung cancer and adenocarcinoma cell lines. QMSP and pyrosequencing showed a high rate of concordant results, even if pyrosequencing revealed two different promoter CpGs sub-islands (P1a and P1b) with a different methylation density pattern.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur results confirm the effect of methylation on KEAP1 transcription control across multiple histologies of lung cancer and suggest pyrosequencing as the best approach to investigate the pattern of CpGs methylation in the promoter region of KEAP1. The validation of this approach on lung cancer patient cohorts is mandatory to clarify the prognostic value of the epigenetic deregulation of KEAP1 in lung tumors.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/20\/11\/2697","name":"Methylation Density Pattern of KEAP1 Gene in Lung Cancer Cell Lines Detected by Quantitative Methylation Specific PCR and Pyrosequencing.","publisher":"Int J Mol Sci.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAL7VskBO59SCOXSwYU1pTpvYalMSCG0WPA,NAME_SEARCH,N3B6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbTLooBZt856gGur1ZLJRzvZEt0QBre-Jg,NAME_SEARCH,YixS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":3,"year":2018},"description":"NRG1 fusions were recently reported as a new molecular feature of Invasive Mucinous Adenocarcinoma (IMA) of the lung.

The NRG1 fusions were widely investigated in Asian IMA cohorts, whereas just anecdotal information are available about the occurrence of NRG1 fusions in IMA Caucasian population. Here we firstly explored a large Caucasian cohort of 51 IMAs and 34 non-IMA cases for the occurrence of NRG1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and RNA target sequencing. FISH results were correlated to the immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated-ErbB3 (pErbB3) receptor and the mutational status of KRAS, EGFR and ALK genes. The NRG1 rearrangements were detected in 31% IMAs and 3% non-IMAs and the CD74-NRG1 fusion transcript variant was characterized in 4 NRG1-positive IMAs. Moreover, pErbB3 expression was found to be strictly associated to the mucinous pattern (p = 0.012, Chi-square test) and all IMA cases showing aberrant expression of pErbB3 demonstrated NRG1 rearrangements. No significant correlation between NRG1 rearrangements and EGFR, KRAS or ALK mutations respectively, was observed. We report for the first time that NRG1 fusions are driver alterations clearly associated with mucinous lung adenocarcinoma subtype of Caucasian patients and not exclusive of Asiatic population. pErbB3 immunostaining may represent a strong predictor of NRG1 fusions, pointing out the detection of pErbB3 by IHC as a rapid and effective pre-screening method to select the NRG1-positive patients.","url":"https:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/article\/23800\/","name":"Frequent NRG1 fusions in Caucasian pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma predicted by Phospho-ErbB3 expression","publisher":"Oncotarget","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAL7VskBO59SCOXSwYU1pTpvYalMSCG0WPA,NAME_SEARCH,N3B6)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAbTLooBZt856gGur1ZLJRzvZEt0QBre-Jg,NAME_SEARCH,YixS)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"day":30,"year":2019},"description":"Thanks to personalized medicine trends and collaborations between industry, clinical research groups and regulatory agencies, next generation sequencing (NGS) is turning into a common practice faster than one could have originally expected.

Moreover, it can be efficiently integrated with an open liquid handling platform to provide high-quality libraries from germline DNA with more reproducibility and high coverage for targeted sequences in less time (BRCA1\/2).

We explored the aberrant methylation of SPARC and its effects in 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and 59 NSCLC tissues and correlated the methylation levels with clinical-pathological features and disease outcome of patients. In 3 out of 4 tumor cell lines high SPARC methylation levels were observed. An inverse correlation between the epigenetic silencing and SPARC expression was confirmed by 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine ((5-Aza-CdR) treatment that also significantly induced a reduction in cell viability, proliferation and tumor cell migration. In tissues, the DNA methylation levels of the SPARC gene were significantly lower in paired non-neoplastic lungs (NLs) and normal lungs distant from tumor (NLDTs) than in NSCLCs (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0034 respectively). A promoter hypermethylation was detected in 68% of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCCs, 17\/25) and 56% of adenocarcinoma (ADCs, 19\/34), with SqCC showing the highest levels of methylation.

At present, the prognostic role of aberrant methylation at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites of the KEAP1 gene promoter is debated in NSCLC, and its correlation with transcriptional changes and protein levels remains to be defined in large sample cohorts. Methods: We evaluated and compared multiple KEAP1 omics data (methylation, transcript, and protein expression levels) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to explore the role of CpGs located in different portions of KEAP1 and the correlation between methylation, transcription, and protein levels. Data from two subsets of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 617) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, n = 571) cohorts of NSCLC patients with different disease stages were evaluated. Results: We found that the methylation levels of many KEAP1 CpGs at various promoter and intragenic locations showed a significant inverse correlation with the transcript levels. Interestingly, these results were limited to the KRAS wild-type LUSC and LUAD cohorts, whereas in LUAD the effect of the epigenetic silencing of KEAP1 on its transcription was also observed in the EGFR mutated subpopulation.

In this review, we will summarize the available knowledge about the dynamic role of DNA methylation in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/journals\/oncology\/articles\/10.3389\/fonc.2023.1137384\/full","name":"Monitoring EGFR-lung cancer evolution: a possible beginning of a \u201cmethylation era\u201d in TKI resistance prediction","publisher":"Frontiers in Oncology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":1,"year":2024},"description":"Immunotherapy revolutionized the treatment landscape of several cancers, including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), with a huge number of practice-changing trials, and becoming a new frontier for their management. The addition of an anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab or durvalumab, to platinum\/etoposide regimen became the standard of care for first-line therapy of extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC with the 12 months median survival exceeded for the first time. Nevertheless, most patients show primary or acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therefore new promising therapeutic immune-targets are under clinical investigation in several solid tumors. Among these, B7-H3, also known as CD276, is a member of the B7 family overexpressed in tumor tissues, including SCLC, while showing limited expression in normal tissues becoming an attractive and promising target for cancer immunotherapy. B7-H3 plays a dual role in the immune system during the T-cell activation, acting as a T-cell costimulatory\/coinhibitory immunoregulatory protein, and promoting pro-tumorigenic functions such as tumor migration, invasion, metastases, resistance, and metabolism. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were the most used methods to assess B7-H3 expression levels and validate a possible relationship between B7-H3 staining patterns and clinicopathological features in lung cancer patients. To date, there are no clinically available therapeutics\/drugs targeting B7-H3 in any solid tumors. The most promising preliminary clinical results have been reported by DS7300a and HS-20093, both are antibody-drug conjugates, that are under investigation in ongoing trials for the treatment of pretreated SCLC. This review will provide an overview of B7-H3 and corresponding inhibitors and the clinical development in the management of SCLC.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1936523323001870?via%3Dihub","name":"B7-H3\/CD276 and small-cell lung cancer: What's new?","publisher":"Translational Oncology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABhkdSgBeHBwNqRWpYHdBySnWFaE-b4Pvag,NAME_SEARCH,fRcK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAh42ZcBmRdWI08H6rrg4qGixrf97zw0eAY,NAME_SEARCH,-VqO)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1712216520000,"insightId":"c611519a-d4d6-49e6-8868-eed6c1ddcd60","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQEzRMBgsdiVVQ\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1712216522983?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=tKbBvqWYO6Ovdzp-sWEPRouNP1i2O19ZU8nPRI3P7qw"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":33},{"type":"PRAISE","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7181556615773339648","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7181556615773339648","reactionsCount":36,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7181556615072927745","message":{"attributes":[{"start":732,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d6nG_M9Z"}}},{"start":757,"length":33,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:54934"}}},{"start":791,"length":39,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:1151494"}}},{"start":831,"length":32,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:166654"}}}],"text":"Contento di aver contribuito a questo commentary sullo studio di Fase 3 PAPILLON che ha mostrato risultati interessanti in termini di riduzione del rischio di progressione della malattia o di morte per amivantamab, un anticorpo monoclonale bispecifico diretto contro due geni chiamati EGFR e MET, in combinazione con la chemioterapia rispetto alla sola chemioterapia in pazienti con carcinoma polmonare non a piccole cellule in stadio avanzato o metastatico, risultati positivi alle mutazioni da inserzione dell'esone20 dell'EGFR. \nSi tratta di enormi progressi scientifici dove il ventaglio di opzioni terapeutiche sta aumentando giorno dopo giorno! \nMerito della ricerca e di chi dedica la propria vita al progresso.
