{"summary":"I am an analytical scientist with extensive experience in analytical method development for the characterization of biopharmaceuticals (mAbs and ADCs) and QC implementation according to GMP regulations and ICH guidelines for release and stability testing of these products. Recently, I started applying my skillset to new chemical entities as well to expand my expertise.\n\nI enjoy working together with colleagues to obtain a deeper understanding of our (new) products and production processes and see how it is all connected to ensure the desired product quality. I like projects that challenge me to combine my abilities to oversee the grand purpose and translating projects into efficient and practical plans. Especially projects that serve innovation and continues improvements keep my enthusiasm and energy level high. In the process I keep an eye on the long-term impact of each decision and make adjustments when new data and insights are obtained to ensure the best outcome. I always want expand and share my knowledge, learn what others can teach me and continue to improve myself.\n\nCurrently, I am leading the design and implementation of Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) within the Analytical department, involved practically to enable structured data strategies and data management of analytical data, improving and expanding the use of statistical tools in method development and life-cycle management and design and execute method development for CE and (U)HPLC techniques with a focus on obtaining and maintaining high quality data. \n\nSpecialties: Primarily capillary electrophoresis, statistics (e.g. DoE, data evaluation tools, trending) and Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD).  (U)HPLC techniques for the characterization and control of mAbs, ADCs and small molecules (e.g. AFF, SEC, peptide mapping, RP) . Using an open and effective communication to realize tasks.","lastName":"van den Berg","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:180945643","geoRegion":"Arnhem-Nijmegen Region","fullName":"Eline van den Berg","firstName":"Eline","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Genmab","description":"- Empower and supervise a team of Biochemistry Research Associates who perform biochemical assays within Genmab\u2019s product development activities, focusing on antibody characterization;\n- Represent analytical and biochemistry expertise within the CMC department;\n- Using different biochemical approaches, to contribute to antibody characterization, stability testing, forced degradation, formulation and QC analysis.
