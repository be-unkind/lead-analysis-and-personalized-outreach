Even in simple perceptual tasks, the aggregation of individuals' personal information can enable enhanced group decision-making. However, in certain circumstances such collaboration can worsen performance, or even expose an individual to exploitation in economic tasks, and therefore a balance needs to be struck between a collaborative and a more egocentric disposition. Neurohumoral agents such as oxytocin are known to promote collaborative behaviours in economic tasks, but whether there are opponent agents, and whether these might even affect information aggregation without an economic component, is unknown. Here, we show that an androgen hormone, testosterone, acts as such an agent. Testosterone causally disrupted collaborative decision-making in a perceptual decision task, markedly reducing performance benefit individuals accrued from collaboration while leaving individual decision-making ability unaffected. This effect emerged because testosterone engendered more egocentric choices, manifest in an overweighting of one's own relative to others' judgements during joint decision-making. Our findings show that the biological control of social behaviour is dynamically regulated not only by modulators promoting, but also by those diminishing a propensity to collaborate.","url":"http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/27\/rspb.2011.2523.full","name":"Testosterone Disrupts Human Cooperation by Increasing Egocentric Behavior","publisher":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAaguagBT3dFBsWCQZnBzXRpNfHDlcTWL9M,NAME_SEARCH,ttkJ)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2010},"description":"Recollection has long been thought to play a key role in associative recognition tasks. Evidence that associative recollection might be a threshold process has come from analyses of the associative recognition receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Specifically, the ROC is not as curvilinear as a signal detection theory requires. In addition, the z-ROC is usually curvilinear, as a threshold recollection model requires, not linear, as a signal detection model requires. In Experiment 1, word pairs were strengthened at study, which yielded a curvilinear ROC and a linear z-ROC (in accordance with signal detection theory). This result suggests that associative recognition performance was based on a continuous variable, one that likely consists of either unitized familiarity or continuous recollection. The remember\u2013 know procedure and an unexpected cued recall test suggested that the more curvilinear ROC in the strong condition was mainly due to increased recollection. In Experiment 2, word pairs were presented for an old\u2013new recognition decision before being presented for an associative recognition decision. When pairs consisting of items not recognized as having been seen on the list were removed from the analysis, the ROC again became curvilinear, the z-ROC again became linear, and most associative recognition decisions were associated with remember judgments. These findings suggest that the curvilinear z-ROC often observed on associative recognition tests results from noise, as a mixture signal detection model assumes, and that recollection is a continuous process that yields a curvilinear ROC that is well characterized by signal detection theory.","url":"http:\/\/wixtedlab.ucsd.edu\/publications\/wixted1\/Mickes_Johnson_Wixted_2010.pdf","name":"Continuous Recollection Versus Unitized Familiarity in Associative Recognition","publisher":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAaguagBT3dFBsWCQZnBzXRpNfHDlcTWL9M,NAME_SEARCH,ttkJ)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1711471020000,"insightId":"514c250f-70cd-4119-ad2e-294db32e803f","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFCPtxu9T7kNQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711066077718?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=4N0gW2qKnXW9sIUZ1O_oU5fPdTP_wWweJ610KlwmTq8","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4E27AQFCPtxu9T7kNQ\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711066077718?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=4N0gW2qKnXW9sIUZ1O_oU5fPdTP_wWweJ610KlwmTq8"}]},"description":"Careers Lead Clinical Research Associate Who We Are: MapLight Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotech company that focuses on drug discovery for central nervous system disorders.
