{"summary":"\ud83d\udcabAs a bioengineer with nearly 10 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, I have honed my skills in process development, analytical chemistry, and troubleshooting complex problems. From medical devices to biologics, I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to manufacturing and analytical development challenges!\n\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\ud83e\uddea Played a pivotal role as the analytical lead for a preclinical ADC program, successfully managing all facets of analytical development, transfer, and qualification (pre-validation).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Delivered extensive technical support to both internal and external team members, demonstrating my ability to handle complex projects, new concepts, and competing priorities with finesse.\n\n\ud83e\uddec Served as SME in sustaining efforts for a $2 billion sequencing consumables portfolio, ensuring continuous production, high-quality releases, adherence to cGMP, maintenance of validated state, and timely shipments.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Identified and addressed a CAPA for progressively degenerating chromatography results that had a growing impact on manufacturing schedules, leading the investigation in partnership with a cross-functional group of experts and implementing solutions to directly mitigate the root cause.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Achieved hands-free automation for 80% of cell culture process handling in a 900-plate inventory by developing an automated liquid handling platform as part of a multidisciplinary team. The outcomes were minimized contamination risks and bolstered downstream assay robustness.\n\nRECCOMENDATIONS\n\"As her manager for nearly 4 years, I greatly appreciated her go-get, ambitious attitude. She often volunteered to take on extra tasks or work that just needed to get done to move programs forward. She never shied away from a new challenging task! Karen was a pillar on our analytical team, someone whom everyone could lean on and trust.\" - Heather Dorth\u00e9, direct manager at Rakuten Medical, 2024\n\n\"I highly recommend Karen for any position that requires her leadership or scientific proficiency. She will exceed your expectations and bring positive energy to your organization.\" - Trung Nguyen, colleague at Rakuten Medical, 2024\n\n\"Karen is a highly capable engineer who picks up new manufacturing processes and technology quickly. Karen is customer focused and is a strong team player. She collaborates strongly across teams and delivers quality work.\" David O'Brien, manager at Illumina, 2019","lastName":"Rodriguez","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:339903713","geoRegion":"San Diego County, California, United States","fullName":"Karen Rodriguez","firstName":"Karen","currentPositions":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABRChOEBrXDU5Zss4j2vTaMm-0tFJ-_STVs,NAME_SEARCH,qQBb)","profilePictureDisplayImage":{"artifacts":[{"width":100,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"100_100\/0\/1709666274878?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=IztU1Pev8m0APdhzJgivQvXRicXV1CRYBoXhrU8Yi90","height":100},{"width":200,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"200_200\/0\/1709666274878?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=REIMTA2qvHnjED59TlEmFAtPlH1uXJ75TdeJuPUsqbg","height":200},{"width":400,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"400_400\/0\/1709666274878?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=b-iO9Ea9yytGxX3DAWCBZEtL1SKi5dXfLjSfIqZ7Baw","height":400},{"width":800,"fileIdentifyingUrlPathSegment":"800_800\/0\/1709666274878?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=VQrn-W2hb-0Bp5p05hjENUdaT_t9j4f8cZ5fZDAy1LA","height":800}],"rootUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5603AQH3pAYHIPjjxA\/profile-displayphoto-shrink_"},"projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":10,"year":2013},"description":"Developed a Linux-based virtual cluster optimized to work with the UCSF DOCK application.

The method physicians currently use to diagnose patients involves subjectively looking at a patient\u2019s eye while running slow and rapid eye movement tests. The system created through this project uses a low cost eye tracking device and software to quantify the diagnosis of PSP, resulting in a more standardized diagnosis. Precision and accuracy of measuring horizontal saccade amplitude, velocity, and latency was tested to determine the robustness of the system. It has been found that through this system, fast, accurate, and inexpensive diagnosis of PSP can be performed.","title":"Device for Quantitative Analysis of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy","startedOn":{"month":9,"year":2014}}],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Biotechnology Research","educations":[{"endedOn":{"year":2015},"degree":"Bachelor of Science (B.S.)","eduId":217996892,"schoolUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:3382","school":"urn:li:fs_salesSchool:3382","fieldsOfStudy":["Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering"],"schoolName":"University of California, San Diego","startedOn":{"year":2010}}],"skills":[{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"21 CFR"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"ISO 13485"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Protein Characterization"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Analytical Chemistry"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Technology Transfer"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Project Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Problem Solving"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"cGMP manufacturing"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Linear Regression"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Hypothesis Testing"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Six Sigma"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Minitab"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Process Modeling"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Training Delivery"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Assay Development"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"CAPAs"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Presentations"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Process Engineering"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Lean Process Improvement"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Process Development"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Verification and Validation (V&V)"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Drug Development"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"AutoCAD"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Vendor Partnerships"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Process Optimization"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Quality by Design"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"ICH"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Quality Management"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Assay qualification"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Continuous Process Improvement"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Collaborative Problem Solving"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Drug Discovery"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Formulation"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Data Analysis"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Root Cause Analysis"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"SolidWorks"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Matlab"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Troubleshooting"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"UV\/Vis Spectroscopy"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Isoelectric Focusing"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Capillary Electrophoresis"},{"numOfEndorsement":2,"name":"Immunofluorescence"},{"numOfEndorsement":3,"name":"Cell Culture"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Liquid Handling"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Antibody dye conjugates"},{"numOfEndorsement":1,"name":"Microsoft Office"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Independent Thinking"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Communication"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Organization Skills"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Technical Documentation"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Cross-functional Team Leadership"},{"numOfEndorsement":0,"name":"Spanish"}],"pronoun":"She\/Her","numOfConnections":294,"patents":[],"headline":"Driving Biotech innovation with my process optimization skills and analytical chemistry knowledge.
