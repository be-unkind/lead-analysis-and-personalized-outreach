evidence suggest that the polypeptide hormone prolactin (PRL) may contribute to breast and prostate tumorigenesis through its interactions with the prolactin receptor (PRLR).  Here we describe the biological properties of LFA102, a humanized neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of PRLR.  This antibody was found to effectively antagonize PRL-induced signaling in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and to block PRL-induced proliferation in numerous cell line models, including in examples of autocrine\/paracrine PRL activity.  A single administration of LFA102 resulted in regression of PRL-dependent Nb2-11 tumor xenografts and significantly prolonged time to progression.  Finally, LFA102 treatment significantly inhibited PRLR signaling as well as tumor growth in a carcinogen-induced, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive rat mammary cancer model as a monotherapy and enhanced the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole when administered in combination.  The biological properties of LFA102, elucidated by the preclinical studies presented here, suggest that this antibody has the potential to be a first in class, effective therapeutic for the treatment of PRL-dependent cancers.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/232709292","name":"Neutralization of Prolactin Receptor Function by Monoclonal Antibody LFA102, a Novel Potential Therapeutic for the Treatment of Breast Cancer.","publisher":"Mol.

This study aimed to evaluate the biochemical, cellular, and antitumor effects of a novel Chk1inhibitor, CHIR124.\nExperimental Design: CHIR-124 was evaluated for its ability to abrogate cell cycle checkpoints,\nto potentiate cytotoxicity, and to inhibit Chk1-mediated signaling induced by topoisomerase I poi- sons in human tumor cell line and xenograft models.\nResults: CHIR-124 is a quinolone-based small molecule that is structurally unrelated to other known inhibitors of Chk1. It potently and selectively inhibits Chk1 in vitro (IC50 = 0.0003 Amol\/L). CHIR-124 interacts synergistically with topoisomerase poisons (e.g., camptothecin or SN-38) in causing growth inhibition in several p53-mutant solid tumor cell lines as determined by isobologram or response surface analysis. CHIR-124 abrogates the SN-38 ^ induced S and G2-M checkpoints and potentiates apoptosis in MDA-MD-435 breast cancer cells. The abroga- tion of the G2-M checkpoint and induction of apoptosis by CHIR-124 are enhanced by the loss of p53.We have also shown that CHIR-124 treatment can restore the level of cdc25A protein, which is normally targeted by Chk1for degradation following DNA damage, indicating that Chk1 signal- ing is suppressed in the presence of CHIR-124. Finally, in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model, CHIR-124 potentiates the growth inhibitory effects of irinotecan by abrogating the G2-M\ncheckpoint and increasing tumor apoptosis.\nConclusions: CHIR-124 is a novel and potent Chk1inhibitor with promising antitumor activities when used in combination with topoisomerase I poisons.","publisher":"Clin Cancer Res 2007","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApxefkBC-vkCo-MTUa4q500l8RwJ8JSpQA,NAME_SEARCH,Qyub)"}]},{"name":"Tezacitabine Enhances the DNA-directed Effects of Fluoropyrimidines in Human Colon Cancer Cells and Tumor Xenografts","publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":1,"year":2007},"description":"Tezacitabine is a nucleoside analogue characterized by a dual mechanism of action. Following intracellular phosphorylation, the tezacitabine diphosphate irreversibly inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, while the tezacitabine triphosphate can be incorporated into DNA during replication or repair, resulting in DNA chain termination. In the present study we have investigated the effect of the combination of tezacitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5- fluoro-20-deoxyuridine (FUdR) on HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells and xenografts. We used response surface analysis (RSA) and clonogenic assay to evaluate combination effects of tezacitabine and 5-FU. Tezacitabine is antagonistic when combined with 5-FU in the RSA assay and does not effect the clonogenicity of HCT 116 cells when compared with cells treated with 5-FU alone. However, when combined sequentially with FUdR, tezacitabine leads to potentiation of cell killing in the clonogenic assay, additivity in the RSA assay, and increased apoptosis when compared to FUdR alone, suggesting that cytotoxicity of fluor- opyrimidines such as FUdR that have more DNA-directed effects can be potentiated by tezacitabine. We also report that oral administration of the fluoropyrimidine capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-FU, in combination with tezacitabine shows statistically significant additivity in the HCT 116 xenograft model. This interaction may be explained by the finding that tezacitabine elevates activity of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), the enzyme required for activation of the capecitabine prodrug in tumors. Our results provide evidence that teza- citabine enhances the DNA-directed effects of fluoropyrimidines in human colon cancer cells and may modulate the antitumor activity of fluoropyrimidines.","publisher":"Biochem Pharmacol","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApxefkBC-vkCo-MTUa4q500l8RwJ8JSpQA,NAME_SEARCH,Qyub)"}]},{"name":"CHIR-258 Is Efficacious in A Newly Developed Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 \u2212Expressing Orthotopic Multiple Myeloma Model in Mice","publishedOn":{"year":2006},"description":"Purpose: The ectopically expressed and deregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results from a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation that occurs in f15% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients and confers a particularly poor prognosis. This study assesses the antimyeloma activity of CHIR-258, a small-molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases that is currently in phase I trials, in a newly developed FGFR3-driven preclinical MM animal model. Experimental Design: We developed an orthotopic MM model in mice using a luciferase- expressing human KMS-11-luc line that expresses mutant FGFR3 (Y373C). The antimyeloma activity of CHIR-258 was evaluated at doses that inhibited FGFR3 signaling in vivo in this FGFR3-driven animal model.\nResults: Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging detected MM lesions in nearly all mice injected with KMS-11-luc cells, which were mainly localized in the spine, skull, and pelvis, resulting in frequent development of paralysis. Daily oral administration of CHIR-258 at doses that inhibited FGFR3 signaling in KMS-11-luc tumors in vivo resulted in a significant inhibition of KMS-11-luc tumor growth, which translated into a significant improvement in animal survival.\nConclusions: Our data provide a relevant preclinical basis for clinical trials of CHIR-258 in FGFR3-positive MM patients.","publisher":"Clin Cancer Res","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAApxefkBC-vkCo-MTUa4q500l8RwJ8JSpQA,NAME_SEARCH,Qyub)"}]},{"name":"PCA062, a P-cadherin  targeting antibody-drug-conjugate, displays potent anti-tumor activity against P-cadherin- expressing malignancies.","publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":1,"year":2021},"description":"The cell surface glycoprotein P-cadherin is highly expressed in a number of malignancies, including those arising in the epithelium of the bladder, breast, esophagus, lung, and upper aerodigestive system. PCA062 is a P-cadherin specific antibody-drug conjugate that utilizes the clinically validated SMCC-DM1 linker payload to mediate potent cytotoxicity in cell lines expressing high levels of P-cadherin in vitro, while displaying no specific activity in P-cadherin-negative cell lines. High cell surface P-cadherin is necessary, but not sufficient, to mediate PCA062 cytotoxicity. In vivo, PCA062 demonstrated high serum stability and a potent ability to induce mitotic arrest. In addition, PCA062 was efficacious in clinically relevant models of P-cadherin-expressing cancers, including breast, esophageal, and head and neck. Preclinical non-human primate toxicology studies demonstrated a favorable safety profile that supports clinical development. Genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal that expression of the multidrug-resistant gene ABCC1 and the lysosomal transporter SLC46A3 differentially impact tumor cell sensitivity to PCA062. The preclinical data presented here suggest that PCA062 may have clinical value for treating patients with multiple cancer types including basal-like breast cancer.","publisher":"Mol.
