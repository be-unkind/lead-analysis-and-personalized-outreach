It is known to occur exclusively in females due to its X-linked transmission. Very few case reports of Aicardi syndrome with an interhemispheric cyst have been published from India. \nCase report\n A 6 month old female infant presented with complaints of asymmetrical spasms, more on the left side since 3 months of age. The child had global developmental delay. On examination she had Microcephaly with increased tone and reflexes. Ophthalmological examination revealed right sided optic nerve head coloboma.\nMRI of the brain showed ACC. A multiloculated inter hemispheric cyst seen on both sides of the midline. EEG shows asymmetrical hypsarrythmias. Earlier child received phenobarbitone, Valproate, levetiracetam without any significant improvement. The child was started on Vigabatrin after which the infantile spasms subsided. \nDiscussion\nIn our case, all the clinical and radiographic criteria for Aicardi and west syndrome were fulfilled. In addition, the patient had an interhemispheric cyst- Type 2b. This report thus demonstrates the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for other CNS malformations when ACC is present. An MRI may thus be helpful to determine a more precise prognosis.\nConclusions \nAicardi syndrome should be suspected in any girl child presenting with infantile spasms, visual problems & Neuroimaging showing agenesis of corpus callosum and should look for other malformations of brain.","publisher":"Journal of pediatric epilepsy","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASgJlQBsBJ_dqtXpOck_lh-eUQ6P1dIwck,NAME_SEARCH,aFf1)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2012},"description":"A 7-year-old boy with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, receiving antiretroviral drugs\nfor 2 years, presented with a recent onset of myoclonic jerks and cognitive deterioration.

CT at admission showed hypodensity in bilateral thalamus and cerebellum. Dengue rapid test was positive. MRI showed signal changes in bilateral thalami and cerebellum. The child started deteriorating with decerebrate posturing, so CT  was done which showed significant dilatation of third and lateral ventricles due to increase in mass effect in posterior fossa.

In the Indian scenario, 20\u201330% of head injuries are seen in the paediatric population between ages 1 and 16 years. [ 1 , 2 ] Vitamin B12 deficiency is very common in infancy and can lead to both haematological and neurological manifestations. Neurological manifestations include global developmental delay, neuroregression, irritability, lethargy, excessive crying, involuntary movements such as tremors and changes in behaviour such as agitation or withdrawal. [ 3 - 5 ] Haematological manifestations of Vitamin B12 deficiency include megaloblastic anaemia and pancytopenia. We report a case of a 6-month-old female infant who suffered an insignificant fall from a cot, resulting in intracranial haemorrhage due to previously unrecognised thrombocytopenia secondary to Vitamin B12 deficiency. A 6-month-old female infant was brought to the emergency room after an alleged history of falling from a cot with onset of vomiting and right focal seizures after three hours. On examination, her weight was 8 kg (0 to +1 Z score), and her head circumference was 42 cm (0 to \u22121 Z score). There was severe pallor and hypopigmented spar hair with knuckle hyperpigmentation. No external injuries were noted. Glasgow Coma Scale: 9\/15, with equal and reactive pupils with a power of 3\/5 (Medical Research Council [MRC] grade), was observed on the right side. Laboratory investigations revealed anaemia-haemoglobin of 6.1 g\/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 106.7, thrombocytopenia (13 \u00d7 10 3 \/uL) and low levels of serum Vitamin B12 121.2 pg\/mL (normal 211\u2013911 pg\/mL) and increased levels of serum homocysteine of 89.83 \u03bcmoL\/L (normal 3\u201350 \u03bcmoL\/L). Peripheral smear examination indicated microcytic hypochromic cells, elongated cells, a few macro ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils. Serum iron was 59.04 ug\/dL (35\u2013145 ug\/dL), Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) was 321.10 ug\/dL (135\u2013392 ug\/ dL), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was 380.14 ug\/ dL (250\u2013400 ug\/dL), transferrin was 310.2 mg\/dL (200\u2013 360 mg\/dL), transferrin saturation was 15.53% (20\u201350%) and serum ferritin of 173.2 ng\/Ml (20\u2013110 ng\/mL). Liver and renal function tests, serum electrolytes and metabolic workup done were normal. An initial computed tomography scan brain showed a haemorrhage in the left frontal region measuring 12 \u00d7 15 mm. Electroencephalogram showed focal epileptiform discharges arising from the left frontal region. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after one month of trauma revealed volume loss and altered signal intensity in the left frontal lobe [ Figure 1a - c ], suggestive of gliosis due to injury. Given the clinical findings of TBI and concurrent Vitamin B12 deficiency, she received intravenous levetiracetam and 3% sodium chloride and supportive care. To address her anaemia, she received packed red blood cells and IV Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) at 1000 mcg\/day for seven days followed by oral supplements continued for three months post-discharge. Due to persistent bicytopenia (severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia) during the prolonged hospital stay of 30 days, bone marrow aspiration was done, suggestive of megaloblastic anaemia. Laboratory values post-treatment were Vitamin B12 of 11850 pg\/mL (normal 211\u2013911 pg\/mL) and normalised levels of homocysteine of 16.68 \u03bcmoL\/L (normal 3\u201350 \u03bcmoL\/L). Her last follow-up at three years of age was found to have mild residual right upper and lower limb weakness [ Figure 1d ]. This case report highlights the unmasking of Vitamin B12 deficiency in an infant following TBI. The fall from the cot resulted in TBI, leading to symptoms such as vomiting and seizures. Despite the seemingly insignificant nature of the fall, the presence of hemiparesis, brain haemorrhage observed on MRI, as well as the co-occurrence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia, raised concerns of underlying Vitamin B12 deficiency. Initially, anaemia was attributed to being secondary to brain haemorrhage by trauma, but the cause of thrombocytopenia could not be explained, which prompted further investigation into Vitamin B12 deficiency along with clinical manifestations. Other causes of anaemia and thrombocytopenia, such as leukaemia, were ruled out after a bone marrow examination. Identification of low Vitamin B12 levels in the patient led to the recognition of an underlying deficiency, which has implications for neurological functioning. Vitamin B12 deficiency is known to have neurological manifestations, including developmental delay\/neuro regression, cognitive impairment in children, peripheral neuropathy and neuropsychiatric manifestations in the older age groups. [ 6 ] In addition to these effects, Vitamin B12 deficiency has also been associated with ischaemic stroke. [ 7 ] Studies have shown that Vitamin B12 deficiency can result in increased levels of homocysteine, an amino acid associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases, including stroke. [ 7 ] However, the exact mechanisms underlying the association between Vitamin B12 deficiency and worse outcomes in ischaemic stroke are still unknown. [ 7 ] While this case report focuses on detailed clinical examination and analysis of investigations influencing the outcome, prompt intervention and appropriate treatment played crucial roles in achieving favourable outcomes. The findings from this case report underscore the importance of considering concomitant nutritional deficiencies in infants with TBI, as they can contribute to the clinical presentation and influence management strategies. The child is currently three years old, with regular follow-up and achieving age-appropriate milestones, weight of 10.6 kg (\u22122 to \u22123 Z score), head circumference of 46 cm (at \u22123 Z score) and mild paucity of movements on the right side. The limitation of the report is we do not have clinical and radiological images during initial admission.

[ 1 ]. Rickettsial infections are underdiagnosed in India due to their non-specific clinical presentation. [ 2 ] The presence of an eschar, less commonly observed in the Indian population, contributes to the diagnostic process. Therefore, we are sharing this image to create more awareness of this treatable life-threatening condition. A 2-year-old female child presented with a fever lasting seven days and seizures on day 6 of fever. On examination, vital signs were stable, revealing three eschars: One over the mid back adjacent to the medial border of the left scapula [ Figure 1a ], over the back below the right scapular region [ Figure 1b ] and the third over the left mastoid region [ Figure 1c ]. On systemic examination, a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5\/15, meningeal irritations, brisk deep tendon reflexes and hepatosplenomegaly were noted. Investigations revealed a total leukocyte count of 18700\/mm 3 , haemoglobin of 10.7g\/dL, platelet count of 44000\/mm 3 , total protein of 4.2 g\/dL, serum albumin of 1.8g\/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 279.3U\/L, alanine aminotransferase of 123.1U\/L, serum urea of 122.9 mg\/dL and serum creatinine of 0.86 mg\/dL. The Weil Felix test was positive for OXK (1:320). Serum and cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were positive for Orientia tsutsugamushi . Work-up for other infections, such as dengue and malaria, was negative. The child was treated symptomatically and with oral doxycycline for seven days, leading to improvement in the child\u2019s condition. Rickettsial eschars are necrotic lesions that occur at the site of tick or mite bites and represent locations of primary inoculation of spotted fever group Rickettsia and Orientia species. [ 3 ] A rickettsial eschar begins as a small, painless papule that appears within a few days after the bite of an infected vector. The papule grows, becomes vesicular or pustular and ulcerates, forming a brown-to-black crust surrounded by a red annular halo. The presence of an eschar can aid in the clinical and epidemiologic differentiation of less severe spotted fever rickettsioses from the more severe Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsial eschars serve as an important clinical specimen.

Knowledge of the phenotype, genotype, and disease mechanism of MiTES is incomplete. Why PRDM12 18A versus 19A can cause almost opposite phenotypes is unknown; no other poly-alanine or poly-glutamine tract expansion disease causes two such disparate phenotypes. Methods: We assessed the genotype and phenotype of 9 new, 9 atypical, and 6 previously reported patients diagnosed with MiTES. Using cell lines with homozygous PRDM12 of 12A (normal), 18A (MiTES) and 19A (CIP) we examined PRDM12 aggregation and subcellular localisation by image separation confocal microscopy and sub-cellular fractionation western blotting. Results: MiTES presents in the first year of life, and in all cases the condition regresses over the first decade leaving scarring. The MiTES phenotype is highly distinctive. Features overlapping with PRDM12-CIP are rarely found. The genotype-phenotype study of PRDM12 polyalanine tract shows that 7A -15A are normal; 16A -18A are associated with MiTES; 19A leads to CIP; and no clinically atypical MiTES cases had an expansion. PRDM12 aggregation and sub-cellular localisation differ significantly between 18A and normal 12A cell lines and between 18A and 19A cell lines. MiTES is a new protein aggregation disease. Conclusion: We provide diagnostic criteria for MiTES, and improved longitudinal data. MiTES and CIP are distinct phenotypes despite their genotypes varying by a single alanine in the PRDM12 polyalanine tract. We found clear distinctions between the cellular phenotypes of normal, MiTES and CIP cells.. We hypothesise that the developmental environment of the trigeminal ganglion is unique and critically sensitive to prenatal and postnatal levels of PRDM12. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.

Objectives: We aim to comprehensively investigate CA8-related disorders (CA8-RD) by reviewing existing literature and exploring neurological, neuroradiological, and molecular observations in a cohort of newly identified patients. Methods: We analyzed the phenotype of 27 affected individuals from 14 families with biallelic CA8 variants (including data from 15 newly identified patients from eight families), ages 4 to 35 years. Clinical, genetic, and radiological assessments were performed, and zebrafish models with ca8 knockout were used for functional analysis. Results: Patients exhibited varying degrees of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), along with predominantly progressive cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs and variable bradykinesia, dystonia, and sensory impairment. Quadrupedal gait was present in only 10 of 27 patients. Progressive selective cerebellar atrophy, predominantly affecting the superior vermis, was a key diagnostic finding in all patients. Seven novel homozygous CA8 variants were identified. Zebrafish models demonstrated impaired early neurodevelopment and motor behavior on ca8 knockout. Conclusion: Our comprehensive analysis of phenotypic features indicates that CA8-RD exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations, setting it apart from other subtypes within the category of CAMRQ. CA8-RD is characterized by cerebellar atrophy and should be recognized as part of the autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxias associated with NDD. Notably, the presence of progressive superior vermis atrophy serves as a valuable diagnostic indicator. \u00a9 2024 The Authors.

Regarding queries raised by the author [2], we would like to highlight our case. The phenotypes associated with ALS2 variants can be following: Juvenile onset Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type 2 (OMIM#205100), Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (OMIM#606353) and Infantile onset ascending spastic paraparesis (OMIM#607225) [3]. The clinical fea- tures of the above three phenotypes are overlapping as all of them come under the group of Motor Neuron disorders. Even though the gene causes 3 phenotypes, our case had ALS phenotype as there were signs of denervation on elec- tromyography, hence reporting as ALS. We could not test the parents for the variant due to cost constraints; however, both the parents were asymptomatic clinically. We do not have objective evidence of Apgar score, but child was apparently well with smooth fetal to neonatal transition phase. Child did not require neonatal intensive care unit support immediately after delivery. As per his- tory, encephalopathy was present in the index case in the form of lethargy and poor feeding. There were no objective grading or scaling documents available to diagnose or grade encephalopathy. Encephalopathy did not last more than 5\u20136 d based on history given by parents. Probable cause was kept as sepsis or hypoglycemia based on historical points given by caretakers. We have undertaken extensive investigations which includes metabolic testing by tandem mass spectrom- etry, urinary organic acids, serum lactate and ammonia, arte- rial blood gases to exclude other causes, which were all nor- mal. Hence based on clinical phenotype and investigations, we diagnosed the case as ALS. Declarations Conflict of Interest None. References 1. Gowda VK, Babu S, Kinhal U, Srinivasan VM.
