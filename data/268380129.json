increasingly recognized as a therapeutic strategy although the lack of objective responses and the development of resistance are major limitations for clinically- available drugs. Endothelial targeted toxins exert increased toxicity compared to antiangiogenic drugs and may therefore overcome these limitations. The specificity and toxicity of targeted toxins may be increased by utilization of a drug delivery system which provides selective release of the targeted toxins in the target cells. Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a non-invasive modality which causes translocation into the cytosol of agents that are trapped in endosomes.  This study describes the first use of PCI in combination with a recombinant fusion toxin targeting tumor vasculature. Endothelial cells bearing VEGFR2 treated with VEGF121\/rGel showed dramatic enhancement of toxicity after PCI. We compared the PCI of VEGF121\/rGel  to  that of  bleomycin  which is currently under clinical evaluation. The VEGFR2 specificity of VEGF121\/rGel was shown to be preserved by the PCI treatment. PCI of VEGF121\/rGel was further shown to induce vascular collapse and edema in the invasive areas of CT26.CL25 colon carcinoma tumors as shown by CD31 IHC. Antitumor effects, as assessed by tumor growth delay was found for PCI of VEGF121\/rGel and PCI of bleomycin with cure rates of 40% and 33% respectively. PCI of VEGF121\/rGel was, however, more tolerated compared to PCI of bleomycin. Thus, PCI of vascular targeted toxins provides higher specificity and increased tolerability compared to PCI of bleomycin and may represent an interesting clinical future for the PCI technology.","publisher":"Journal of Control Release","url":"http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/sd\/article\/S0168365914000698","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA__J-EB-57GorZJOklvYmcyFlv9Wx0p_Q0,NAME_SEARCH,B0d3)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAZF8T4BHlCfYvZw-RepnqW0kektVAAWdHw,NAME_SEARCH,IfBb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA9Zp20BDNomySq7WFcGcu1XdWe0fDB-DPY,NAME_SEARCH,7V7m)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASOyzUBlks-fXVdQySqlFcFWKZQ-0gzbtc,NAME_SEARCH,aqKz)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":11,"year":2020},"description":"Lysosomal accumulation of sunitinib has been suggested as an underlying mechanism of resistance. Here, we investigated if photochemical internalization (PCI), a technology for cytosolic release of drugs entrapped in endosomes and lysosomes, would activate lysosomal sequestered sunitinib. By super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, sunitinib was found to accumulate in the membrane of endo\/lysosomal compartments together with the photosensitizer disulfonated tetraphenylchlorin (TPCS2a). Furthermore, the treatment effect was potentiated by PCI in the human HT-29 and the mouse CT26.WT colon cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic outcome of sunitinib-PCI was, however, highly dependent on the treatment protocol. Thus, neoadjuvant PCI inhibited lysosomal accumulation of sunitinib. PCI also inhibited lysosomal sequestering of sunitinib in HT29\/SR cells with acquired sunitinib resistance, but did not reverse the resistance. The mechanism of acquired sunitinib resistance in HT29\/SR cells was therefore not related to lysosomal sequestering. Sunitinib-PCI was further evaluated on HT-29 xenografts in athymic mice, but was found to induce only a minor effect on tumor growth delay. In immunocompetent mice sunitinib-PCI enhanced areas of treatment-induced necrosis compared to the monotherapy groups. However, the tumor growth was not delayed, and decreased infiltration of CD3-positive T cells was indicated as a possible mechanism behind the failed overall response.","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6694\/12\/2\/417","name":"Photochemically-Induced Release of Lysosomal Sequestered Sunitinib: Obstacles for Therapeutic Efficacy","publisher":"Cancers (Basel)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA__J-EB-57GorZJOklvYmcyFlv9Wx0p_Q0,NAME_SEARCH,B0d3)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABLFwQBsj6j3dxmh7bDwXRk_ZwobgnvRyc,NAME_SEARCH,r9YB)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAASOyzUBlks-fXVdQySqlFcFWKZQ-0gzbtc,NAME_SEARCH,aqKz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA_QpeUBAabIvmrz1h1WfPmBxejbIwr2Xq4,NAME_SEARCH,HRrz)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABYdRTAB-KdYg1arks2kD50DYTQdRh8z-Fo,NAME_SEARCH,41XW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAMVUtgBj7A2YKtOiGmA8DF-7Rl3pI9wHeo,NAME_SEARCH,HMJx)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAvNvh0Ba_HUjor9CeXhJFjPBhCTXGjjIp8,NAME_SEARCH,AGGs)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"year":2013},"description":"Tyrosin kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies aimed to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown limited effect as monotherapies and drug resistance is a major limitation for therapeutic success.

Bringing forth these protein toxins from the bench to the bedside strongly depends on the availability of production methods that are reproducible, scalable and comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP). The type I ribosome-inhibiting protein, gelonin, has great potential as an anticancer drug, but is sequestrated in endosomes and lysosomes. This can be overcome by combination with photochemical internalization (PCI), a method for endosomal drug release. The combination of gelonin-based drugs and PCI represents a tumor-targeted therapy with high precision and efficiency. The aim of this study was to produce recombinant gelonin (rGel) at high purity and quantity using an automated liquid chromatography system. The expression and purification process was documented as highly efficient (4.4 mg gelonin per litre induced culture) and reproducible with minimal loss of target protein (~50% overall yield compared to after initial immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)). The endotoxin level of 0.05-0.09 EU\/mg was compatible with current standards for parenteral drug administration. The automated system provided a consistent output with minimal human intervention and close monitoring of each purification step enabled optimization of both yield and purity of the product. rGel was shown to have equivalent biological activity and cytotoxicity, both with and without PCI-mediated delivery, as rGelref produced without an automated system. This study presents a highly refined and automated manufacturing procedure for recombinant gelonin at a quantity and quality sufficient for preclinical evaluation.

This is reflected in the composition of anticancer drugs which includes compounds directed towards the immune system and tumor-vasculature in addition to drugs aimed at the cancer cells themselves. Drug-based treatment regimens are currently designed to include compounds targeting the tumor stroma in addition to the cancer cells. Treatment limiting adverse effects remains, however, one of the major challenges for drug-based therapy and novel tolerable treatment modalities with diverse high efficacy on both tumor cells and stroma is therefore of high interest. It was hypothesized that the vascular targeted fusion toxin VEGF121\/rGel in combination with the intracellular drug delivery technology photochemical internalization (PCI) stimulate direct cancer parenchymal cell death in addition to inhibition of tumor perfusion, and that an immune mediated response is relevant for treatment outcome. The aim of the present study was therefore to elucidate the anticancer mechanisms of VEGF121\/rGel-PCI. In contrast to VEGF121\/rGel monotherapy, VEGF121\/rGel-PCI was found to mediate its effect through VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and a targeted treatment effect was shown on two VEGFR1 expressing cancer cell lines. A cancer parenchymal treatment effect was further indicated on H&E stains of CT26-CL25 and 4 T1 tumors. VEGF121\/rGel-PCI was shown, by dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, to induce a sustained inhibition of tumor perfusion in both tumor models. A 50% complete remission (CR) of CT26.CL25 colon carcinoma allografts was found in immunocompetent mice while no CR was detected in CT26.CL25 bearing athymic mice.

Currently used EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have specific limitations related to toxicity and development of resistance, and there is a need for alternative treatment strategies to maximize the clinical potential of EGFR as a molecular target. This study describes the design and production of a novel EGFR-targeted fusion protein, rGel\/EGF, composed of the recombinant plant toxin gelonin and EGF. rGel\/EGF was custom-made for administration by photochemical internalization (PCI), a clinically tested modality for cytosolic release of macromolecular therapeutics. rGel\/EGF lacks efficient mechanisms for endosomal escape and is therefore minimally toxic as monotherapy. However, PCI induces selective and efficient cytosolic release of rGel\/EGF in EGFR-expressing target cells by light-directed activation of photosensitizers accumulated selectively in tumor tissue. PCI of rGel\/EGF was shown to be highly effective against EGFR-expressing cell lines, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines resistant to cetuximab (Erbitux). Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy were identified as mechanisms of action following PCI of rGel\/EGF in vitro. PCI of rGel\/EGF was further shown as a highly tumor-specific and potent modality in vivo, with growth inhibitory effects demonstrated on A-431 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) xenografts and reduction of tumor perfusion and necrosis induction in SCC-026 HNSCC tumors.
