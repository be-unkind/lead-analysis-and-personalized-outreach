This work is part of a series of studies of the optical properties of different carboxylic acids in aqueous media. The experimental electronic spectra of GA exhibit two strong well-separated absorption peaks (B- and C-bands), which agree with previous studies. However, in the current study, an additional well-defined low-energy shoulder band (A-band) in the optical spectra of GA was identified. It is likely that the A-band occurs for other carboxylic acids in solution, but because it can overlap with the B-band, it is difficult to discern. The theoretical calculations based on density functional theory were used to simulate the optical absorption spectra of GA in water at different pH to prove the existence of this newly found shoulder band and to describe and characterize the full experimental optical spectra of GA. Different cluster models were tested: (i) all water molecules are coordinated near the carboxy-group and (ii) additional water molecules near the hydroxy-groups of the phenyl ring were included. In this study, we found that both the polarizable continuum model (dielectric property of a medium) and neighboring water molecules (hydrogen-bonding) play significant roles in the optical spectrum. The results showed that only an extended cluster model with water molecules near carboxy- and hydroxy-groups together with the polarizable continuum model allowed us to fully reproduce the experimental data and capture all three absorption bands (A, B, and C). The oscillator strengths of the absorption bands were obtained from the experimental data and compared with theoretical results. Additionally, our work provides a detailed interpretation of the pH effects observed in the experimental absorption spectra.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.1c07333","name":"Absorption Spectra and the Electronic Structure of Gallic Acid in Water at Different pH: Experimental Data and Theoretical Cluster Models","publisher":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABESMX4BTJDsowS0TPT6qtxwCj48boQ_NZI,NAME_SEARCH,GwxP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC5ExcsB4I4PwHA-La91nyxQyk_8IG22OM0,NAME_SEARCH,ql7T)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":2,"day":11,"year":2020},"description":"The absorption spectra of molecular organic chromophores in aqueous media are of considerable importance in environmental chemistry. In this work, the UV-vis spectra of benzoic acid (BA), the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid, in aqueous solutions at varying pH and in the presence of salts are measured experimentally. The solutions of different pH provide insights into the contributions from both the non-dissociated acid molecule and the deprotonated anionic species. The microscopic interpretation of these spectra is then provided by quantum chemical calculations for small cluster models of benzoic species (benzoic acid and benzoate anion) with water molecules. The following main conclusions from these calculations and the comparison to experimental results can be made: (i) the small water cluster yields good quantitative agreement with observed solution experiments; (ii) the main peak position is found to be very similar at different levels of theory and is in excellent agreement with the experimental value, however, a weaker feature about 1 eV to lower energy (red shift) of the main peak is correctly reproduced only by using high level of theory, such as Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC); (iii) dissociation of the BA into ions is found to occur with a minimum of water molecules of n = 8; (iv) the deprotonation of BA has an influence on the computed spectrum and the energetics of the lowest energy electronic transitions; (v) the effect of the water on the spectra is much larger for the deprotonated species than for the non-dissociated acid.

Theoretical optical absorption and CD spectra of the model clusters are in good agreement with experimental data.

It was shown that the gold core geometry deformation due to ligation and the nature of the ligand play the most important roles in the chiroptical activity of the gold clusters. In addition, the ligands determine the gold core structural deformation and affect the high-energy region of the CD spectra, whereas the gold core itself exhibits a significant effect on the shape and sign of the CD spectra in the low energy region with wavelengths above \u223c350 nm.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jpcc.7b12264","name":"Chiroptical Activity in BINAP- and DIOP-Stabilized Octa- and Undecagold Clusters","publisher":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry C","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABESMX4BTJDsowS0TPT6qtxwCj48boQ_NZI,NAME_SEARCH,GwxP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAE9LDABr-4Nnq7wrAg2y73B6gUSOKfsvps,NAME_SEARCH,9j8s)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":22,"year":2014},"description":"Fluorescent, DNA-stabilized silver clusters are receiving much attention for sequence-selected colors and high quantum yields.

For sodium chloride containing solutions, mixed with either sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) or sodium acetate (NaAc), the ClNO2 branching fraction (\u03a6ClNO2) is suppressed relative to a sodium chloride only solution. In the case of the sulfate-chloride solution, \u03a6ClNO2 is reduced from 0.85 \u00b1 0.03 (0.5 M NaCl) to 0.32 \u00b1 0.14 upon the addition of 2.0 M Na2SO4. In the case of the acetate-chloride solution, \u03a6ClNO2 is reduced to 0.18 \u00b1 0.03 upon the addition of 0.5 M NaAc. In contrast, no statistically significant suppression in \u03a6ClNO2 was observed for the addition of sodium perchlorate up to 3.0 M, implying that an increase in ionic strength of the solution does not necessitate a reduction in \u03a6ClNO2. We suggest that the reduction in \u03a6ClNO2 may result from a direct reaction between SO42\u2013 (and Ac\u2013) with NO2+ (or NO2+NO3\u2013) which competes with the NO2+ + Cl\u2013 reaction that produces ClNO2. The dependence of \u03a6ClNO2 on SO42\u2013 and Ac\u2013 is compared with both a time-dependent reaction-diffusion model and recent field observations, suggesting that the reaction rate of SO42\u2013 (or Ac\u2013) with NO2+ would need to be similar in magnitude to the rate of the NO2+ + Cl\u2013 reaction to explain the observed suppression in \u03a6ClNO2. We show that the dependence of \u03a6ClNO2 on particulate sulfate and carboxylate can be readily incorporated into existing parametrizations of ClNO2 heterogeneous chemistry. The results presented here indicate that anions which are ubiquitous in atmospheric aerosol, yet commonly considered to be unreactive, may regulate the production of reactive gases such as ClNO2.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acsearthspacechem.9b00177","name":"Sulfate and Carboxylate Suppress the Formation of ClNO2 at Atmospheric Interfaces","publisher":"ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABESMX4BTJDsowS0TPT6qtxwCj48boQ_NZI,NAME_SEARCH,GwxP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABs0N5QBumsm7HEjJRFKRCta6cRL-M4Ju64,NAME_SEARCH,GTE2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA7NAjcBevA4HR0ElaA40_gJ-hIAfDKod9M,NAME_SEARCH,WB1x)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":23,"year":2015},"description":"Time-dependent density functional theory methods are employed to examine the evolution of the absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of neutral bare silver helical nanostructures as a function of their geometrical parameters.

In marine environments, these light absorbing components are often at the air\u2013water interface and can participate in the chemistry of the atmosphere in ways that are poorly understood. Understanding the photochemistry and photophysics of these systems represents a major challenge since their composition and structures are not unique. In this study, we present a successful microscopic model of this light absorbing macromolecular species termed \u201cmarine derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter\u201d or \u201cm-CDOM\u201d in water. The approach taken involves molecular dynamics simulations in the ground state using on the fly Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) electronic structure theory; Time Dependent DFTB (TD-DFTB) calculations of excited states, and experimental measurements of the optical absorption spectra in aqueous solution. The theoretical hydrated model shows key features seen in the experimental data for a collected m-CDOM sample. As will be discussed, insights from the model are: (i) the low-energy A-band (at 410 nm) is due to the carbon chains combined with the diol- and the oxy-groups present in the structure; (ii) the weak B-band (at 320\u2013360 nm) appears due to the contribution of the ionized speciated form of m-CDOM; and (iii) the higher-energy C-band (at 280 nm) is due to the two fused ring system. Thus, this is a two-speciated formed model. Although a relatively simple system, these calculations represent an important step in understanding light absorbing compounds found in nature and the search for other microscopic models of related materials remains of major interest.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2021\/CP\/D0CP06554D","name":"Towards a Microscopic Model of Humic Material in Aqueous Solution: Computed Absorption Spectrum and Comparison with Experiment","publisher":"Phys.

This work compares the photodegradation of 2-nitrophenol (2NP), 4-nitrophenol (4NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (24DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (246TNP) in 2-propanol and water to better understand the photochemical loss of nitrophenols in atmospheric organic particles and aqueous droplets. Polychromatic quantum yields were determined by monitoring the loss of absorbance of each nitrophenol with UV\/vis spectroscopy in the presence of an acid (undissociated nitrophenol) or base (nitrophenolate). There was no orderly variation between loss rates in the organic and aqueous phases: 2NP and 4NP had similar yields in the two solvents. 246TNP was an outlier in these results as it dissociated in both acidified 2-propanol and water due to its exceptionally strong acidity. A notable result is that only for 24DNP was a dramatically increased reactivity found in 2-propanol compared to that in water. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations were carried out to characterize the excited state energies and absorption spectra with a conductor-like polarizable continuum model or explicit solvation by a few solvent molecules. Explicit solvent calculations suggest the enhanced reactivity of 24DNP in 2-propanol is due to the strong interaction between a 2-propanol molecule and an \u2013NO2 group in the excited state. For the other nitrophenols, the solvent effects on electronic structure were minimal. Overall, the observations in this work suggest that solvent effects on the electronic structure and condensed-phase photochemistry of nitrophenols are minimal, with the exception of 24DNP.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlehtml\/2023\/ea\/d2ea00144f","name":"Influence of solvent on the electronic structure and the photochemistry of nitrophenols","publisher":"Environmental Science: Atmospheres","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABESMX4BTJDsowS0TPT6qtxwCj48boQ_NZI,NAME_SEARCH,GwxP)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACH1vjMBbw5bO1ISWHLNuI4mf1BArYx2mRM,NAME_SEARCH,lfDV)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1714676100000,"insightId":"f75cb32b-5405-40e1-aa01-fb2e8749e182","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D5622AQFPOaDoA4XYqA\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1714676129925?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=fuiDVgIIYA_LOVW6nglcJxnl1Ar_it0qCi8t18VErJE"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":37},{"type":"PRAISE","count":7}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7191872952512995329","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7191872952512995329","reactionsCount":44,"commentsCount":7,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7191872951502176256","message":{"attributes":[{"start":355,"length":6,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:94086444"}}},{"start":694,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:drugdiscovery"}}},{"start":710,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:computationalchemistry"}}},{"start":735,"length":16,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:machinelearning"}}},{"start":753,"length":3,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ai"}}},{"start":758,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:publichealth"}}}],"text":"\ud83c\udf89 Exciting news!
