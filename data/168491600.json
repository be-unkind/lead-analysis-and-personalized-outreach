For this theoretical modeling, silicon is the base layer (substrate) and the functional layer can be selected according to the chemical detection. The mass sensitivity factor and spring constant change before and after chemical reactions have been analyzed theoretically by taking minimum of four hundred samples in each case study. Finally, the specific dimensions and guidelines for designing high sensitivity polymer coated microcantilever for chemical sensing application based on the case study have been suggested. The optimized microcantilever is theoretically analyzed with detection of water vapour and primary alcohols.
