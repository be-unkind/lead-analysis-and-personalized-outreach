{"summary":"A focused and highly competent Electrical Engineer working with Bayer US LLC- Radiology department and an MSEE graduate with experience in Electronics and Embedded Systems with PCB design. Published author with working knowledge of research and development for best practices of Electronics design.\n\nAs a MSEE student as part of my master's degree, I completed a thesis work titled \"Trauma Detection Personal Locator Beacon System.\" In this work, I developed a system for the detection of trauma to automatically activate a distress signal (i.e. PLB systems) to get medical help for people left incapacitated or unconscious in remote areas. This involved the integration of various bioelectronic systems into an embedded device for the signal processing and analysis of the data. This work included the design, testing, and debugging of the system through PCB design and software implementation.\n\nA few of my technical skills include:\n- Analog\/Digital circuit design, signal conditioning circuits\n- Circuit simulation tools: PSpice and Proteus\n- AutoDesk Eagle, DipTrace\n- MATLAB\/Simulink\n- Embedded C\/C++\n- Microcontrollers: PIC18, PIC16 and ATmega series\n- Embedded IDEs: MPLab IDE, MPLab IPE, AVR Studio, Arduino\n- Serial communication protocols: UART, I2C and SPI\n- Electrical equipment operation: Oscilloscopes, Function Generators, Multimeters, Power supplies, \n  Soldering\n\nContact Information:\nEmail: sakshisharma180692@gmail.com","lastName":"Sharma","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:398485733","geoRegion":"Indianola, Pennsylvania, United States","fullName":"Sakshi Sharma","firstName":"Sakshi","currentPositions":[{"companyName":"Bayer","description":"\u2022 Analyzed schematics of many systems and subsystems assemblies.
