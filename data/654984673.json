After a year of various appointments, labs, scans...she was finally getting surgery.\n\nAs she was heading into the OR, I rushed myself to a keynote I was giving Queen's University \/ Smith School of Business at Queen's University for International Women's Day for 7:30am before heading back to the hospital.\n\nToday flew by so quickly and it made me reflect on the value of time. They say 'you can't buy time', but over the past year of supporting my mom - I realize you can if you make a conscious decision to.\n\nWhen I was a student away at university, I only saw my parents during the holidays b\/c it was expensive to frequently go back home.\n\nThen in med school and residency (now 6 figures in debt), I would often work 6am-7pm, on weekends, doing 24-hour on call shifts....and if I was lucky I could see my parents once a month.\n\nEach time I saw them, they looked significantly older, thinner and with more white hair than the last time...\n\nAs an attending, with my debts paid off, I prioritized financial independence, broadening my income streams so I wasn't working so much all the time. I cut my clinical work down from 6 days a week to 3 days. I was glad I put my wellness first, b\/c that's when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Except this time, I had a lot more time to take care of her.\n\nI realized early that if I kept working the way I did, I would retire with a lot more money but not my health nor family around to enjoy those earnings with. Life is short, and disease or disability can happen earlier than you think. The earlier I prioritized my financial wellness, the more time I bought for myself to enjoy my healthy years with loved ones. #internationalwomensday   #financialindependence"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7171687748876054528"}}},{"createdAt":1716044880000,"insightId":"ee469b26-b574-41f7-b44f-e9eef8ca2e85","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7197613847686365185,7197614010370834432)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7197613847686365185","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"For Part 1: https:\/\/youtu.be\/cz8rbGyyjLw?si=fMxOjSfJ-beoGoGk"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7197613847686365185"}}},{"createdAt":1716044400000,"insightId":"7f4c1a40-fc50-4291-8fae-45182dcecc69","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7192558337639485441,7197611975311306753)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7192558337639485441","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"For Part 2 of the series: https:\/\/youtu.be\/JRb_jFp_uHs"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:activity:7192558337639485441"}}},{"createdAt":1714444560000,"insightId":"82f09e88-4395-4466-87ac-a35d7e489d1a","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7185992858049372161,7190901860629712896)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7185992858049372161","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"Congrats Nardin!!
