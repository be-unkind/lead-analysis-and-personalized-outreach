proposed. These definitions frequently describe (1) who is considered a cancer survivor and experiencing cancer survivorship, (2) what it means to be survivor and experience survivorship, and (3) when someone is considered a survivor and survivorship begins. Descriptive epidemiology indicates that certain individuals diagnosed and treated for cancer describe the presence of specific unmet needs following diagnosis and treatment for cancer. Evidence also points to an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence or a new cancer in many cancer patients. These observations should be reflected in the case definitions of cancer survivor and cancer survivorship. This paper reviews the evidence as it relates to the validity of existing definitions of cancer survivor and cancer survivorship. Based on this evidence, a cancer survivor is defined as an individual diagnosed with cancer. The period following primary treatment, which is characterized by transitions in care and a need to address the late effects of cancer and its treatment, may be a particularly critical time for the cancer survivor. The definition does not preclude the major involvement of family, friends, caregivers, and providers, but does place the focus on the individual who received the diagnosis of cancer. Children and young adult cancer survivors should be housed in subgroups under the \u201ccancer survivor\u201d umbrella. Further, we define cancer survivorship to be the period of time beginning at cancer diagnosis where attention by the survivor and his or her care team is directed at addressing needs related to health, symptoms, function, lifestyle, and well-being; these needs may change through care trajectory. Coordination of care between oncologist specialists involved in the early phases of cancer diagnosis and treatment and primary care physicians involved in long-term follow-up is critical...","url":"http:\/\/revistas.ucm.es\/index.php\/PSIC\/article\/view\/48900\/45626","name":"Defining Cancer Survivor and Cancer Survivorship: The Who, What, and When","publisher":"Psicooncolog\u00eda","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQDAyoBJszxGNWFJAplkKy_kBxse9fJ7mc,NAME_SEARCH,594X)"}]},{"name":"The journal of cancer survivorship: informing health care providers and cancer survivors","publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":8,"year":2014},"publisher":"The Journal of Cancer Survivorship \/ Springer","url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11764-014-0358-2\/fulltext.html","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQDAyoBJszxGNWFJAplkKy_kBxse9fJ7mc,NAME_SEARCH,594X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABFDTC8BF4qo_ZYT-wW9iXTT1o1vdw2KQ3g,NAME_SEARCH,HWUP)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"day":23,"year":2013},"description":"There has been an increase in the prevalence of adults diagnosed with and treated for primary brain tumors. Cognitive deficits are a common long-term effect in brain tumor survivors. The objective of this paper is to examine whether these deficits are specific to those diagnosed with and treated for a primary brain tumor. A systematic review of the medical literature from 2002 to 2012 was conducted to investigate neurocognitive deficits in brain tumor survivors (post-primary treatment) compared to healthy controls. Four studies were identified that met all inclusion criteria. Gliomas were the most common form of tumor included. Neuropsychological evaluation identified cognitive deficits in brain tumor survivors on tests of working memory, cognitive control and flexibility, cognitive processing speed, visual searching, planning and foresight, and general attention. While age, education, and gender can influence cognitive function, the present review indicates that deficits exist beyond those accounted for by these factors. Many primary brain tumor survivors are involved in roles (e.g., employee, parent, spouse\/partner, student) that require optimal performance of these cognitive skills. Future research should evaluate brain tumor survivors on functional challenges resulting from these cognitive sequelae and develop effective ways to mitigate them.

Common secondary endpoints include PAH functional class (FC), which assesses symptoms, and either brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the inactive N-terminal cleavage product of its prohormone (NT-proBNP), which assesses cardiac function.\nObjective: Examine the relationships among 6MWD, FC, and BNP\/NT-proBNP measured at baseline or follow-up with long-term outcomes in PAH studies.\nMethods: Relevant literature from January 1990 to April 2018 were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Articles in English reporting on associations between 6MWD, FC, or BNP\/NT-proBNP and outcomes in PAH were identified. Each endpoint was evaluated individually. Prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied at level 1 (titles\/abstracts) and level 2 (full-text review).\nResults: The database search yielded 836 unique records; 65 full-text articles were reviewed. Twenty-five studies were eligible for inclusion. Findings supported the importance of measuring PAH noninvasive endpoints in predicting long-term outcomes. Patients with shorter or decreased 6MWD, poor (III\/IV) or declining FC (e.g., from II to III), or elevated or increasing BNP\/NT-proBNP had a higher risk of death and costly events (e.g., hospitalization, lung transplant). FC also predicted health care resource utilization and costs. Collectively, these endpoints establish risk groups that predict likelihood of complications from PAH or death.\nConclusion: Assessment of 6MWD, FC, and BNP\/NT-proBNP provides low-cost, efficient, and noninvasive means of predicting long-term health and economic outcomes in patients with PAH.","url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00408-019-00289-2","name":"The Role of Noninvasive Endpoints in Predicting Long-Term Outcomes in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","publisher":"Lung","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQDAyoBJszxGNWFJAplkKy_kBxse9fJ7mc,NAME_SEARCH,594X)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":7,"day":30,"year":2020},"description":"The What Matters Most (WMM) study was initiated to evaluate symptoms, AD-related impacts, treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities among individuals with or at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and their care partners.

Studies included pharmacological intervention or registry studies with individuals with preclinical or prodromal AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild, moderate, or severe AD, or caregivers of these individuals, and at least one type of COA.\n\nRESULTS: Over 900 records were retrieved. Records from the literature and Clinicaltrials.gov searches were combined and coded, yielding a total of 109 records for final review. Performance measures were the most common type of COA identified. COAs were most frequently used in MCI, and mild and moderate AD populations; COAs were used less often among prodromal\/preclinical and severe AD populations. The six most frequently reported COAs identified were ADAS-Cog, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC).\n\nCONCLUSION: Performance measures (e.g., MMSE & CDR) were the most common type of COA identified, followed by clinician-reported and observational measures. Only three COAs were used in all 5 AD populations: MMSE, ADCS-ADL, NPI. Very few patient-reported measures were identified; the most frequently being the EQ5D ( used in 4\/5 AD populations). The most commonly used clinician-reported measures included the NPI, ADCS-CGIC, and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The next phase of this work will assess the extent to which these existing measures capture the concepts that are most important to individuals with or at risk for AD and their care partners as identified in the WMM study.","url":"https:\/\/www.rtihs.org\/sites\/default\/files\/30503%20Hauber%202020%20Evaluation%20of%20what%20matters%20most%20in%20existing%20clinical%20outcomes%20assessments%20in%20Alzheimer%27s%20Disease.pdf","name":"Evaluation of what matters most in existing clinical outcomes assessments in Alzheimer's Disease","publisher":"2020 Alzheimer's Association Virtual International Conference (AAIC)","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQDAyoBJszxGNWFJAplkKy_kBxse9fJ7mc,NAME_SEARCH,594X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAGaWVgB6DpeoffZJvPCNdheiGPNAuzW1Ug,NAME_SEARCH,XaoK)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAVwczkBJrCQqOMntfPtiDKfwCwuUz09CYc,NAME_SEARCH,MRWP)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":12,"day":7,"year":2021},"description":"Geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, can result in irreversible blindness over time. We performed a systematic literature review to assess the humanistic and economic burden of GA.\nPredefined search terms were used to identify studies in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library; conference abstracts also were searched.\nOf 1111 studies identified, 25 studies on humanistic burden, 4 on economic burden, and 3 on both humanistic and economic burden of GA were included. Vision-related functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are poor in patients with GA. HRQOL is commonly measured using the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25); patients with GA have significantly lower composite and subscale scores for near activities, distance activities, dependency, driving, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, color vision, and peripheral vision than individuals without GA. Driving is a particular concern, and inability to drive affects dependency. Vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) declines as GA progresses. While we identified only 7 reports describing the economic burden of GA, its direct costs may be substantial. In a US study, mean cost to the payer per patient with GA was $11,533 in the year after diagnosis. A multinational study estimated annualized total direct costs of \u20ac 1772 per patient with GA, mainly driven by diagnostic tests and procedures (\u20ac 1071). Patients with GA are at increased risk of falls and fractures, potentially increasing direct costs. Only one study evaluated indirect costs, estimating \u223c$24.4 billion in yearly lost wages among people with severe vision loss due to GA or drusen \u2265 125 \u03bcm.\nGA represents a significant humanistic burden. Evidence on the economic impact of GA is limited; characterizing the economic burden of GA requires further research. Interventions that reduce GA-related disability may improve HRQOL and reduce indirect costs.","url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=71306","name":"Humanistic and Economic Burden of Geographic Atrophy: A Systematic Literature Review","publisher":"Clinical Ophthalmology","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQDAyoBJszxGNWFJAplkKy_kBxse9fJ7mc,NAME_SEARCH,594X)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAActIIIBOpvtg2Nlf6t_xedocuhfjuaBDVk,NAME_SEARCH,QLHb)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABGZ8QkBISOBiVVyvE_8iqY4LkorT_lGSfg,NAME_SEARCH,PPnG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAUBqo0BWA3bwcvrKou1MvtNKAwvk8c5e60,NAME_SEARCH,f8nL)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAANEz68BxtESQcUzxREDVUFvCLe_8NoUE8Y,NAME_SEARCH,iPKw)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715347680000,"insightId":"b952111d-e664-4857-92ac-7588d0ac570c","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":6}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194689663800885250","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194689663800885250","reactionsCount":6,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194689663272394752","message":{"attributes":[{"start":3,"length":12,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:isporannual"}}},{"start":135,"length":20,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oxfordpharmagenesis"}}}],"text":"At #ISPORAnnual this year, I attended sessions that highlighted the importance of including patients in research and decision making.\n\n#OxfordPharmaGenesis provides support with patient partnership groups, quantitative and qualitative data generation via social media listening and AI tools, and patient experience surveys.\n\nSend me a message to learn more about how we can partner with you!"},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4E22AQH42Xr3vuEgnQ\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1715334429474?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=5C5qQOzQoLuVfsVNclScCM3-bhbFRbCyUjerhW93GUE"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194634060965576704","message":{"attributes":[{"start":82,"length":20,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oxfordpharmagenesis"}}},{"start":433,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:discovermore"}}},{"start":449,"length":15,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:patientseu2024"}}}],"text":"Will *insights* be your priority at Patients as Partners this year?\n\nSpeak to the #OxfordPharmaGenesis team about:\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1 patient partnership groups\n\ud83d\udc42 quantitative and qualitative data generation via social\u202fmedia listening and AI tools\n\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f patient experience data and surveys.\n\nOur Patient\u202fEngagement and\u202fPolicy Teams are\u202fcommitted to\u202fadvocating for\u202fcontinued\u202fimprovement in\u202fhealthcare, for the\u202fbenefit of all.\n\nGet in touch to #DiscoverMore!\n\n#PatientsEU2024"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194634060965576704"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7194689663272394752"}}},{"createdAt":1715216880000,"insightId":"4a094eed-aad4-417b-a792-1ed2004f22b2","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"VIDEO","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/dms.licdn.com\/playlist\/vid\/D4E05AQGtgvbovYrr7g\/videocover-firstframe-low\/0\/1715216906975?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=ZHeZjlSHKY_rEsA5n9I_Y3C_hnBYR02CGN8_lqsm3YQ"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":24},{"type":"PRAISE","count":1},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":3}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7194141127757754368","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7194141127757754368","reactionsCount":28,"commentsCount":3,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7194141127757754368","message":{"attributes":[{"length":12,"start":955,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:isporannual"}}},{"length":6,"start":968,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ispor"}}},{"length":5,"start":975,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:heor"}}},{"length":20,"start":981,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:oxfordpharmagenesis"}}}],"text":"ISPOR 2024\u2026 Wow, what a conference!
