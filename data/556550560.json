animals. HIF is an \u03b1\/\u03b2-heterodimeric transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in a tissue context-dependent manner. The major hypoxia-sensing component of the HIF system involves oxygen-dependent catalysis by the HIF hydroxylases; in humans there are three HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) and an asparaginyl hydroxylase (factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH)). PHD catalysis regulates HIF\u03b1 levels, and FIH catalysis regulates HIF activity. How differences in HIF\u03b1 hydroxylation status relate to variations in the induction of specific HIF target gene transcription is unknown. We report studies using small molecule HIF hydroxylase inhibitors that investigate the extent to which HIF target gene expression is induced by PHD or FIH inhibition. The results reveal substantial differences in the role of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation in regulating hypoxia-responsive genes in cells. PHD inhibitors with different structural scaffolds behave similarly. Under the tested conditions, a broad-spectrum 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase inhibitor is a better mimic of the overall transcriptional response to hypoxia than the selective PHD inhibitors, consistent with an important role for FIH in the hypoxic transcriptional response. Indeed, combined application of selective PHD and FIH inhibitors resulted in the transcriptional induction of a subset of genes not fully responsive to PHD inhibition alone. Thus, for the therapeutic regulation of HIF target genes, it is important to consider both PHD and FIH activity, and in the case of some sets of target genes, simultaneous inhibition of the PHDs and FIH catalysis may be preferable.","url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/291\/39\/20661.long","name":"Tuning the Transcriptional Response to Hypoxia by Inhibiting Hypoxia-inducible Factor (HIF) Prolyl and Asparaginyl Hydroxylases.

Over the last years, there have been multiple reports that describe additional PHD substrates other than HIFs. Among them are the large subunit of RNA Pol II, several transcription factors, and components of signalling pathways. Validating these reports is of major medicinal relevance given that PHD inhibitors are now in the late stage Phase 3 clinical trials. In order to investigate the selectivity of PHDs, the reported proteins have been tested as substrates for hydroxylation by Mass Spectrometry, and as binders or competitors of the PHDs. Initial work on peptides that contain the putative hydroxylation sites has indicated that the PHDs are much more selective for their well-established substrate HIF. However, in ongoing work these initial results are going to be validated on protein level by co-expressing PHDs with the reported substrates. Additionally, peptides of reported substrates were screened for their ability to alter the kinetics of HIF-hydroxylation by PHD2. An inhibitory effect of at least two different peptides on PHD2 was observed, suggesting that there is an interaction between the prolyl hydroxylase and these peptides. In order to investigate the mode of binding and inhibition, NMR studies have been carried out and binding of the two inhibitory peptides on PHD2 has been shown. Altogether, these results indicate that, although PHDs might be more selective for HIF as a substrate as it was initially thought, the enzymatic activity of the prolyl hydroxylases is possibly influenced by a number of other proteins that can directly bind to PHDs.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/292564730_Exploring_the_Substrate_Selectivity_of_Oxygen_Sensing_Prolyl_Hydroxylases","name":"Exploring the Substrate Selectivity of Oxygen Sensing Prolyl Hydroxylases.

To gain insight into the factors underlying different PHD substrates and properties, we carried out biochemical and biophysical studies on PHD homologues from the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, both lacking HIF. The respective prolyl-hydroxylases (DdPhyA and TgPhyA) catalyze prolyl-hydroxylation of S-Phase Kinase Associated Protein 1 (Skp1), a reaction enabling adaptation to different dioxygen availability. Assays with full length Skp1 substrates reveal substantial differences in the kinetic properties of DdPhyA and TgPhyA, both with respect to each other and compared with human PHD2; consistent with cellular studies TgPhyA is more active at low dioxygen concentrations than DdPhyA. TgSkp1 is a DdPhyA substrate and DdSkp1 is a TgPhyA substrate. No cross-reactivity was detected between DdPhyA\/TgPhyA substrates and human PHD2. The human Skp1 E147P variant is a DdPhyA and TgPhyA substrate, suggesting some retention of ancestral interactions. Crystallographic analysis of DdPhyA enables comparisons with homologues from humans, Trichoplax adhaerens, and prokaryotes, TgPhyA informing on differences in mobile elements involved in substrate binding and catalysis. In DdPhyA, two mobile loops that enclose substrates in the PHDs are conserved, but the C-terminal helix of the PHDs is strikingly absent.

An attractive alternative is the conjugation of the ASO to an antibody that facilitates access to the central nervous system (CNS) after peripheral application and target engagement at the blood\u2013brain barrier, followed by transcytosis. Here, we show that the diligent conjugate design of Brainshuttle-ASO conjugates is the key to generating promising delivery vehicles and thereby establishing design principles to create optimized molecules with drug-like properties. An innovative site-specific transglutaminase-based conjugation technology was chosen and optimized in a stepwise process to identify the best-suited conjugation site, tags, reaction conditions, and linker design. The overall conjugation performance was found to be specifically governed by the choice of buffer conditions and the structure of the linker. The combination of the peptide tags YRYRQ and RYESK was chosen, showing high conjugation fidelity. Elaborate conjugate analysis revealed that one leading differentiating factor was hydrophobicity. The increase of hydrophobicity by the ASO payload could be mitigated by the appropriate choice of conjugation site and the heavy chain position 297 proved to be the most optimal. Evaluating the properties of the linker suggested a short bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) unit as best suited with regards to conjugation performance and potency. Promising in vitro activity and in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior of optimized Brainshuttle-ASO conjugates, based on a microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) targeting oligonucleotide, suggest that such designs have the potential to serve as a blueprint for peripherally delivered ASO-based drugs for the CNS in the future.","url":"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.3c00393","name":"Diligent Design Enables Antibody-ASO Conjugates with Optimal Pharmacokinetic Properties","publisher":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACEsSaABb62h9XMMM9pJOzKI38EwOgFcHww,NAME_SEARCH,IROO)"}]},{"name":"LINKERS FOR SITE-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY CONJUGATION","description":"Abstract\n(EN) Herein is reported a polypeptide-linker-nucleic acid conjugate, wherein the linker comprises a 3-amino propanamide unit, a 2,6-diamino hexanoic acid amide unit, and a 1,4,5,5a,6,6a,7,8-octahydrocyclopropa[5,6]cycloocta[1,2-d]-1,2,3-triazole unit, wherein the polypeptide comprises a C-terminal lysine residue, and wherein the nucleic acid comprises an oxygen linked to a phosphorous atom of the oxidation state V at the 5' or 3' terminus, wherein the 3-amino group of the 3-amino propanamide unit and the carboxy function of the lysine residue of the polypeptide are linked by\/form an amide bond, the carboxy function of the 3-amino propanamide unit and the alpha amino group of the 2,6-diamino hexanoic acid amide unit are linked by\/form an amide bond, the 6-amino group of the 2,6-diamino hexanoic acid amide unit is a nitrogen of the 1,2,3-triazole element of the 1,4,5,5a,6,6a,7,8- octahydrocyclopropa[5,6]cycloocta[1,2-d]-1,2,3-triazole unit, and the oxygen linked to the phosphorous atom of the nucleic acid is covalently linked to the cyclopropane element of the 1,4,5,5a,6,6a,7,8-octahydrocyclopropa[5,6]cycloocta[1,2-d]-1,2,3- triazole unit.","publisher":"Patent, WO2024\/017923","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAACEsSaABb62h9XMMM9pJOzKI38EwOgFcHww,NAME_SEARCH,IROO)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716490560000,"insightId":"0c99ede1-0899-4190-b2e6-5da00e6df3d8","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":29},{"type":"PRAISE","count":2},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7199483267945762816","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7199483267945762816","reactionsCount":32,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7199483267081744384","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Today, I had the pleasure of being a panellist alongside Morten Grunnet and Iraida Soria Espinosa at the Discovery Europe Conference."},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"mediaContentSummary":{"mediaType":"STILLIMAGE","thumnailUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/D4D22AQGT6t6Q2LVCtg\/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536\/0\/1716481037925?e=1720051200&v=beta&t=MCVrSjdDvLEdtCHwd8EWZkuJmqfw6SAo9YXnUOfFXiI"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7199443289027055617","message":{"attributes":[{"start":49,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:discoveryeurope24"}}},{"start":74,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:287032001"}}},{"start":110,"length":30,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.CompanyAttributedEntity":{"company":"urn:li:company:18725672"}}},{"start":199,"length":13,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:556550560"}}}],"text":"Two well-spent days in Basel this week attending #DiscoveryEurope24  with Alexandra Phillips representing the UK Dementia Research Institute. \n\nI also had the pleasure to share a pannel session with Kerstin Hofer and Morten Grunnet, from Roche and Lunbeck.
