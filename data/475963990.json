{"summary":"When I was young, I always wanted to be around my friends that were on my little league football teams and help them as much as I could. The energy I felt when we ran a play in a game, and it was successful was special. From little league to college I kept that same mindset of always putting the team first no matter what.\n\n Now, I\u2019m still on a team but it is a dynamic team.\n\nHelping people grow is something that always intrigued me. The first few months of my career I realized I had a thing for finding software solutions for our customers. Being a trusted advisor is my top priority on this global team I am part of now. Every day is game-day and I cannot wait to help our global customers run plays that are successful. \n\nIn 2015, I embarked on an Engineering degree as well as competing in the South Eastern Conference (SEC) one of the highest levels of college football one can play in. The competitive nature of balancing schoolwork in the classroom and on the field has transferred over to the State and Local Government team here at Citirx. I look forward to connecting with you and running plays for you to be successful in the near future.","lastName":"D.","objectUrn":"urn:li:member:475963990","geoRegion":"Nashville Metropolitan Area","fullName":"Daytrieon D.","firstName":"Daytrieon","currentPositions":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABxeolYBA_zY3JCdB9k11cNmDjQVT2NTx4w,NAME_SEARCH,RoyA)","projects":[{"endedOn":{"month":12,"year":2014},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABxeolYBA_zY3JCdB9k11cNmDjQVT2NTx4w,NAME_SEARCH,RoyA)"}],"description":"                                                             Off-Shore Wind Turbine Project\n\tFor this project, we planned to design an off-shore floating wind turbine. The main challenge of this project is maintaining the turbine and making sure its stable on the water because the weight distribution of wind turbines is not exactly ideal for a moving base material like water. Another challenge that adds to this is the weather. The turbine has to be able to withstand storms like hurricanes or tsunamis, large waves, possibly even water vehicles or animals that could interfere with its functionality, not to mention much higher wind speeds than land, which is the reason for off-shore turbines in the first place. The wind turbine we constructed must be able to withstand different categories of hurricanes. \n","title":"WInd Turbine Calculations ","startedOn":{"month":9,"year":2014}},{"endedOn":{"month":5,"year":2014},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABxeolYBA_zY3JCdB9k11cNmDjQVT2NTx4w,NAME_SEARCH,RoyA)"}],"description":"\n\tAt the beginning of the Money Market Competition, I knew that the key to success in the stock market is to devise a plan and execute it.

The second section of this report talks about the oil and gas extraction industry in Arkansas.  Specifically, about the number of people employed in this industry, the number of oil and gas extraction companies, the net income of the industry, and the most common product.  The third section of this report discusses in more detail about the location, the mission statement, the number of employees, and the products of Murphy Oil Corporation. Additionally, the financial reports for Murphy Oil Corporation in 2013 are attached in the Appendix. The fourth section of this report provides a description of our renewable energy cost reduction project as well as a breakeven analysis for the projected project.

The Suspension system need to be able to keep the riders from feeling every bump or change in curvature in the road. The amplitude and the omega was calculated for a period of time to see if the suspension was properly managing the change in the road. During the process the values of C, W(omega), K factor was changed to see how the suspension would respond over a period of time. The amplitude charts listed below show the frequency of the roads and how much the car is bouncing. In a perfect world, you would want little to none amplitude differences in the road. As stated before you also don\u2019t want the car to bottom outThe better the suspension system is in the car the more comfortable the rider will feel. The weight of the vehicle plays a major part in the suspension and the way the vehicle responds to the road. The heavier the vehicle is the more difficult it is to maintain stabilization in the car. On the other hand, the less weight the vehicle has the easier it is for the suspension system to make a smooth ride over a bumpy road. The Suspension system should be able to minimize the amplitude as time goes on. The graph listed below are examples of combinations that minimized the amplitude differences. The wave patterns should go from big to small as the car drives down the road. In general the whole entire main focus of this topic is to find the best combination C, W, and K to minimize the roughness of the road that is created when driving.","title":"Dynamics (Spring Mass System demonstrated on Excel)","startedOn":{"month":9,"year":2014}},{"endedOn":{"month":5,"year":2015},"members":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABxeolYBA_zY3JCdB9k11cNmDjQVT2NTx4w,NAME_SEARCH,RoyA)"}],"description":"The main focus of our project is to create a highly effective lockout buzzer system for the Countdown Round of MATHCOUNTS competition.

The latrines were to be designed using local, cheap materials, while meeting a certain set of requirements that were confirmed by the client. The latrines needed to withstand the tropical climate of Honduras, be able to serve a family of around six to eight people for 10-14 years, and decrease the spread of disease via flies, while not having an unpleasant odor. DLT has worked to research various latrine designs, looking to present a design that would be efficient and ideal in Gualaco. \nDLT presented three designs for review, which gave the client several options to decide which design was the best fit for the area and the needs there. The three initial designs for the 50% design review were the single-pit sealed latrine, urine-diverting latrine, and the two-pit pour-flush latrine. To reach a conclusion on which design would be the most ideal, a comparison of various factors such as cost, durability, and compatibility with the requirements was conducted among the three latrines. DLT\u2019s recommendation was the two-pit pour-flush latrine, which the client agreed was the best option. Some aspects of the design were altered by the client during the 50% design report, which gave DLT the necessary information to work towards the final design for the two-pit pour-flush latrine.\n","title":"JR Clinic Latrine System","startedOn":{"month":1,"year":2015}}],"contactInfo":{},"industry":"Hospitals and Health Care","educations":[{"degree":"Bachelor of Engineering -
