It is also a biomarker for some diseases. These require NH3 sensors for health and safety reasons. To boost the sensitivity of solid-state sensors, the effective sensing area should be increased. Two methods are explored and compared using an evaporating pool of 0.5 mL NH4OH (28% NH3). In the first method an array of Si nanowires (Si NWA) is obtained via metal-assisted-electrochemical etching to increase the effective surface area. In the second method CVD graphene is suspended on top of the Si nanowires to act as a sensing layer. Both the effective surface area as well as the density of surface traps influences the amplitude of the response. The effective surface area of Si NWAs is 100 \u00d7 larger than that of suspended graphene for the same top surface area, leading to a larger response in amplitude by a factor of ~7 notwithstanding a higher trap density in suspended graphene. The use of Si NWAs increases the response rate for both Si NWAs as well as the suspended graphene due to more effective NH3 diffusion processes.","url":"https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1674-4926\/39\/6\/063001\/meta","name":"Ammonia Sensing using Arrays of Silicon Nanowires and Graphene","publisher":"Journal of Semiconductors","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABEjnG8ByKG4mWpl5u6UdoHXvDm8DM_IAXM,NAME_SEARCH,FzoQ)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAd2nMUB8Usiyu4y75hVyCwHUeprON7ENvk,NAME_SEARCH,2eoW)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABCfd3QBD30wmbBXR4ZnI0dG_5kgqIbsxcQ,NAME_SEARCH,UQ3S)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":10,"year":2017},"description":"In this paper, we report a method to improve sensitivity for CMOS ISFET arrays using Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) as a post-processing technique. The process etches away the passivation layers of the commercial CMOS process, using an oxygen (O 2 ) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) plasma. The resulting attenuation and pH sensitivity are characterised for five dies etched for 0 to 15 minutes, and we demonstrate that capacitive attenuation is reduced by 196% and pH sensitivity increased by 260% compared to the non-etched equivalent. The spread of trapped charge is also reduced which relaxes requirements on the analogue front-end.
