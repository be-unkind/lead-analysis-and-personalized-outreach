This explorative passion eventually drew me to focus on Lyme disease research\u2014a field where patients, often feeling neglected by the medical system, suffer in silence from the mysterious sequelae of Lyme infections. This reminded me powerfully of many in my community who felt overlooked and underserved by scientific advances that didn't address their needs.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t have a Lyme problem, we have a tick problem. \n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, the geographic expansion of ticks and the substantial increase of new and reemerging tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have become a major global public health concern. TBDs are not only impacting humans but are also having a staggering impact on the global livestock industry, affecting over 80% of the world's cattle population with annual economic damages caused by TBDs in the livestock sector estimated to be between $13.9 billion and $18.7 billion worldwide.\n\nThus, although Moderna and Pfizer are developing a Lyme Disease vaccine, these do not protect against the myriad of other TBDs that can be transmitted by just a single deer tick, let alone other disease-carrying ticks. This realization calls to mind the history of the Lyme vaccine, LYMErix\u2122, approved in 1998 but subsequently withdrawn from the market. This history underscores the urgent need for comprehensive solutions that address all facets of the problem.\n\nI am thrilled to share that, in collaboration with Massventures and Brigham and Women's Hospital, we are developing a first-in-class solution aimed at preventing the spread of all tick-borne diseases. Our goal is not just to innovate but to provide hope to those who have felt left behind by scientific advances. I am motivated by the potential of scientific innovation to change lives and offer a beacon of hope to communities globally affected by these increasing threats.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the fight against tick-borne diseases, I invite you to join me in this mission to combat tick-borne diseases. Together, we can make a significant impact on global public health\n#LymeDisease #PublicHealth #Innovation #CohenGive\n#TickBorneIllness #Biotechnology #GlobalHealth #livestock #gatesfoundation"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7189629176608395264"}}},{"createdAt":1715969820000,"insightId":"dbc294d5-2645-497f-941d-0338a2b5dbfb","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7197278188463345664,7197299289927098369)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7197278188463345664","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":1,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[],"text":"CONGRATULATIONS!!"},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7197278188463345664"}}},{"createdAt":1714398060000,"insightId":"47b953e0-483c-4fb0-8655-f9aa63271d7f","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(activity:7189629179552776192,7190706824973627393)","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7189629179552776192","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:352668119"}}}],"text":"Alister Martin, Thank you so much for your kind words and for being a dynamic leader in our ecosystem!
