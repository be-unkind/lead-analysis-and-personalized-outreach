Adsorption caused by the affinity of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids toward these surfaces leads to electrode fouling. We compared the performance of boron-doped diamond (BDD) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes for the electrochemical oxidation and cleavage of peptides. An optimal working potential of 2000 mV was chosen to ensure oxidation of peptides on BDD by electron transfer processes only. Oxidation by electrogenerated OH radicals took place above 2500 mV on BDD, which is undesirable if cleavage of a peptide is to be achieved. BDD showed improved cleavage yield and reduced adsorption for a set of small peptides, some of which had been previously shown to undergo electrochemical cleavage C-terminal to tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) on porous carbon electrodes. Repeated oxidation with BDD electrodes resulted in progressively lower conversion yields due to a change in surface termination. Cathodic pre-treatment of BDD at a negative potential in an acidic environment successfully regenerated the electrode surface and allowed for repeatable reactions over extended periods of time. BDD electrodes are a promising alternative to GC electrodes in terms of reduced adsorption and fouling and the possibility to regenerate them for consistent high-yield electrochemical cleavage of peptides. The fact that OH-radicals can be produced by anodic oxidation of water at elevated positive potentials is an additional advantage as they allow another set of oxidative reactions in analogy to the Fenton reaction, thus widening the scope of electrochemistry in protein and peptide chemistry and analytics.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac303795c?prevSearch=roeser&searchHistoryKey=","name":"Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes for the Electrochemical Oxidation & Cleavage of Peptides","publisher":"Analytical Chemistry","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADI37wBHODHd748g8U5yuWiijuYKJOkBpA,NAME_SEARCH,ZcJT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAXSjsUBIIVV_7saNOvd7Yy5uEgslZrmdEw,NAME_SEARCH,Si9Y)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":10,"year":2013},"description":"This work presents a method for selective labeling and detection of electrochemically cleaved Tyr- and Trp-containing peptides for which reaction conditions have been optimized with hexylamine as labeling agent.

A set of Tyr and Trp-containing tripeptides has been studied to investigate the mechanistic aspects of electrochemical oxidation and the subsequent chemical reactions including peptide bond cleavage, making this the first detailed study of the electrochemistry of Trp-containing peptides. The effect of adjacent amino acids was studied leading to the conclusion that the ratios of oxidation and cleavage products are peptide-dependent and that the adjacent amino acid can influence the secondary chemical reactions occurring after the initial oxidation step. The effect of parameters such as potential and solvent conditions showed that control of the oxidation potential is crucial to avoid dimer formation for Tyr and an increasing number of oxygen insertions (hydroxylations) for Trp, which occur above 1000 mV (vs Pd\/H2). While the formation of reactive intermediates after the first oxidation step is not strongly dependent on experimental conditions, an acidic pH is required for good cleavage yields. Working under strongly acidic conditions (pH 1.9-3.1) led to optimal cleavage yields (40-80%), whereas no or little cleavage occurred under basic conditions. Online EC-MS allowed determining the optimal potential for maximum cleavage yields, whereas EC-LC-MS\/MS revealed the nature and distribution of the reaction products.","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac101086w","name":"Electrochemical Oxidation and Cleavage of Tyrosine- and Tryptophan-Containing Tripeptides","publisher":"Analytical Chemistry - American Chemical Society","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADI37wBHODHd748g8U5yuWiijuYKJOkBpA,NAME_SEARCH,ZcJT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2Q0a8B9shysfbukSOAvx-SEClZ2v1QxqE,NAME_SEARCH,NFSq)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":8,"year":2010},"description":"Oxidation of proteins and peptides is a common phenomenon, and can be employed as a labeling technique for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Nonspecific oxidative labeling methods can modify almost any amino acid residue in a protein or only surface-exposed regions. Specific agents may label reactive functional groups in amino acids, primarily cysteine, methionine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Nonspecific radical intermediates (reactive oxygen, nitrogen, or halogen species) can be produced by chemical, photochemical, electrochemical, or enzymatic methods. More targeted oxidation can be achieved by chemical reagents but also by direct electrochemical oxidation, which opens the way to instrumental labeling methods. Oxidative labeling of amino acids in the context of liquid chromatography(LC)\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics allows for differential LC separation, improved MS ionization, and label-specific fragmentation and detection. Oxidation of proteins can create new reactive groups which are useful for secondary, more conventional derivatization reactions with, e.g., fluorescent labels. This review summarizes reactions of oxidizing agents with peptides and proteins, the corresponding methodologies and instrumentation, and the major, innovative applications of oxidative protein labeling described in selected literature from the last decade.","url":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/c5322mm687757773\/","name":"Oxidative protein labeling in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics","publisher":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry - Springer","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAADI37wBHODHd748g8U5yuWiijuYKJOkBpA,NAME_SEARCH,ZcJT)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAA2Q0a8B9shysfbukSOAvx-SEClZ2v1QxqE,NAME_SEARCH,NFSq)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1715201160000,"insightId":"b76daa18-33a9-4b1d-a707-b6de1c607c28","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"PRAISE","count":20},{"type":"APPRECIATION","count":2},{"type":"LIKE","count":90},{"type":"EMPATHY","count":9}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7194075094623662081","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7194075094623662081","reactionsCount":121,"commentsCount":12,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7194075092199358465","message":{"attributes":[],"text":"Quantall Team is ready!
