Crystal structure and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of BpML1 in complex with known macro- cyclics and other derivatives led to the identification of a key chemical scaffold. This scaffold possesses inhibitory potency for BpML1 without the immunosuppressive components of related macrocyclic agents. Biophysical characterization of a compound series with this scaffold allowed binding site specificity in solution and potency determinations for rank ordering the set. The best compounds in this series possessed a low-micromolar affinity for BpML1, bound at the site of enzymatic activity, and inhib- ited a panel of homologous Mip proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, without demonstrating toxicity in human macro- phages. Importantly, the in vitro activity of BpML1 was reduced by these compounds, leading to decreased macrophage infectiv- ity and intracellular growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei.

Point mutations in the polymerase basic protein 2 subunit (PB2) have been linked to the adaptation of the viral infection in humans (2). Findings from such studies have revealed the biological significance of PB2 as a virulence factor, thus highlighting its potential as an antiviral drug target. The structural genomics program put forth by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) provides funding to Emerald Bio and three other Pacific Northwest institutions that together make up the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID). The SSGCID is dedicated to providing the scientific community with three-dimensional protein structures of NIAID category A-C pathogens. Making such structural information available to the scientific community serves to accelerate structure-based drug design. Structure-based drug design plays an important role in drug development. Pursuing multiple targets in parallel greatly increases the chance of success for new lead discovery by targeting a pathway or an entire protein family. Emerald Bio has developed a high-throughput, multi-target parallel processing pipeline (MTPP) for gene-to-structure determination to support the consortium.

In this chapter, we discuss two applications for small molecule libraries in structural genomics: unbiased fragment screening, to provide inspiration for lead development, and targeted, knowledge-based screening, to confirm or correct the functional annotation of a given gene product. This shift in emphasis results in a structural genomics effort that is more engaged with the infectious disease research community, and one that produces structures of greater utility to researchers interested in both protein function and inhibitor development.

In this study, we report fragment screening methods and structure determination results for 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclo-diphosphate (MECP) synthase from Burkholderia pseudomallei, the gram-negative bacterium which causes melioidosis. Screening by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as crystal soaking followed by X-ray diffraction led to the identification of several small molecules which bind this enzyme in a critical metabolic pathway. A series of complex structures obtained with screening hits reveal distinct binding pockets and a range of small molecules which form complexes with the target. Additional soaks with these compounds further demonstrate a subset of fragments to only bind the protein when present in specific combinations.

In this work, we describe a novel approach toward screening fragments against RNA that uses a chemical probe to target the Tat-binding region of TAR. This probe fulfills two critical roles in the screen: by locking the RNA into a conformation capable of binding other fragments, it simultaneously allows the identification of proximal binding fragments by ligand-based NMR. Using this approach, we have discovered six novel TAR-binding fragments, three of which were docked relative to the probe\u00e2\u0080\u0093RNA structure using experimental NMR restraints. The consistent orientations of functional groups in our data-driven docked structures and common electrostatic properties across all fragment leads reveal a surprising level of selectivity by our fragment-sized screening hits. These models further suggest linking strategies for the development of higher-affinity lead compounds for the inhibition of the TAR\u00e2\u0080\u0093Tat interaction.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022283611003159","name":"A small-molecule probe induces a conformation in HIV TAR RNA capable of binding drug-like fragments","publisher":"Elsevier","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAAaGxsB8qndvC_cJsHT812QsIGborOOVXM,NAME_SEARCH,pN4D)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":1,"year":2011},"description":"The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID) is a consortium of researchers at Seattle BioMed, Emerald BioStructures, the University of Washington and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that was established to apply structural genomics approaches to drug targets from infectious disease organisms.

Target selection engages the infectious disease research and drug-therapy communities to identify drug targets, essential enzymes, virulence factors and vaccine candidates of biomedical relevance to combat infectious diseases. The protein-expression systems, purified proteins, ligand screens and three-dimensional structures produced by SSGCID constitute a valuable resource for drug-discovery research, all of which is made freely available to the greater scientific community. This issue of Acta Crystallographica Section F, entirely devoted to the work of the SSGCID, covers the details of the high-throughput pipeline and presents a series of structures from a broad array of pathogenic organisms.

It has been proposed that a variety of mycobacteria can subsist on alternative carbon sources during latency within an infected human host, with the help of enzymes such as nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase (NTA-Mo). NTA-Mo is a member of a class of enzymes which consist of two components: A and B. While component A has monooxygenase activity and is responsible for the oxidation of the substrate, component B consumes cofactor to generate reduced flavin mononucleotide, which is required for component A activity. NTA-MoB from M. thermoresistibile, a rare but infectious close relative of M. tuberculosis which can thrive at elevated temperatures, has been expressed, purified and crystallized. The 1.6\u2005\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of component B of NTA-Mo presented here is one of the first crystal structures determined from the organism M. thermo\u00adresistibile. The NTA-MoB crystal structure reveals a homodimer with the characteristic split-barrel motif typical of flavin reductases. Surprisingly, NTA-MoB from M. thermoresistibile contains a C-terminal tail that is highly conserved among myco\u00adbacterial orthologs and resides in the active site of the other protomer. Based on the structure, the C-terminal tail may modulate NTA-MoB activity in mycobacteria by blocking the binding of flavins and NADH.","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3169409\/","name":"Crystal Structure of nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase component B from Mycobacterium thermoresistibile.","publisher":"Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun.","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAAaGxsB8qndvC_cJsHT812QsIGborOOVXM,NAME_SEARCH,pN4D)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEnbs8Bbs36749bwCCwSwkfqKVjTTu0PdA,NAME_SEARCH,SpuC)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAQJNMEB89fY01REu4aKIAlfChuxPMEGnMY,NAME_SEARCH,zkjG)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAEyEM4Bq5R5VFRx0o9tiMLS-aGEUZDAAIA,NAME_SEARCH,7BJ1)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIuWkgB43IvIGiZRBfD1AXB8N-W_ewH80E,NAME_SEARCH,U9Pn)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABnOKAB0eSAs_lQ_4Rf0CD8QEvW5q13uXU,NAME_SEARCH,zrvE)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAlBZs0BOeVcsK9PBstuR9NXFWWqni7Vp3w,NAME_SEARCH,hv-n)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAABLAAkB2FxfY3wafMe-OIlWqU2cWEnlul0,NAME_SEARCH,ECpy)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAHLHgwBUskmTpTi2tzepfEz4X7FY51R46g,NAME_SEARCH,HfVq)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":5,"day":17,"year":2010},"description":"Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a versatile tool for the study of binding interactions between small molecules and macromolecular targets. We applied ligand-based NMR techniques to the study of human thymidylate synthase (hTS) using known nanomolar inhibitors and a library of small molecule fragments. Screening by NMR led to the rapid identification of ligand pairs that bind in proximal sites within the cofactor-binding pocket of hTS. Screening hits were used as search criteria within commercially available sources, and a subset of catalog analogs were tested for potency by in vitro assay and binding affinity by quantitative saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR titration. Two compounds identified by this approach possess low micromolar affinity and potency, as well as excellent binding efficiency against hTS. Relative binding orientations for both leads were modeled using AutoDock, and the most likely bound conformations were validated using experimentally derived STD-NMR binding epitope data. These ligands represent novel starting points for fragment-based drug design of non-canonical TS inhibitors, and their binding epitopes highlight important and previously unexploited interactions with conserved residues in the cofactor-binding site","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20626411","name":"Fragment-based discovery of novel thymidylate synthase leads by NMR screening and group epitope mapping.","publisher":"Chem Biol Drug Des. 2010 Sep 1;76(3):218-33.
