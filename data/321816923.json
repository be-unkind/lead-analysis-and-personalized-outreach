The sun is not setting in this import substituting industry. The three Japanese players are here for the last 3-4 decades, and they have only faced meaningful competition in the last decade or so \u2013 first the government relaxed the used car import policy (2011 onwards) which was followed by a policy that has allowed new entrants to enter the CKDmarket (2016 onwards). And now(2021 onwards), the government is pushing OEMs to start exporting. Japanese are perhaps not happy with this, as reportedly, Japanese government has threatened to take Pakistan to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for forcing its three car assembling companies to export, as they think that it is a clear violation of WTO rules. Without getting into the trade laws and legal debate, the Pakistan government has multiple ways to tighten the screws. The duty structure of CBU and CKD can be tweaked to reduce the protection of the local assemblers (CKD market) which is dominated by these three Japanese players. Having said that, the OEMs are at a disadvantage to an extent. To gain competitiveness for surviving without protection and (or) exporting (parts and fully assembled cars), a certain scale is required. In 2007-08, when the car market was around 200k units, the talks were of getting to 500K to attain scale.At that time, there were a mere three players in the market. Today, the number is much higher and used cars imports are on the rise too. And this year (FY24), combined CKD and CBU, the full year salesare likely to be below 125k. How can someone be competitive in this market? Some would bleed. It\u2019s either the consumer or theproducer. The consumer is beneficiary of enhanced competition in the last decade. The buyer has multiple options. The market has moved from \u2018on\u2019 to \u2018off\u2019, as lately, players have reduced prices by 2-2.5 percent on certain variants (including hot cakes). Others are doing the same. Some are selling cars in instalments without charging any interest. That is unheard of in a market where OEM usually raise working capital from consumers while keeping their surplus cash invested in treasury instruments. It is not easy for Japanese to dominate the market and influence the policies. The time has changed. Producer has to offer some value \u2013 mainly in terms of low pricing after localization. This might not be happening. For example, in Toyota Cross the assembler claims to have 50 percent localization; however, its price net of all taxes is around $23,900 which is a mere 3 percent to discount to net of taxes price in UAE where CBU is imported. And perhaps, excluding dealer margins, the car is cheaper in Dubai. Where is the advantage of 50 percent localization in Pakistan? These kinds of pressing questions would be raised in a low volume market with growing competition. And with the low benefit of localization, export is becoming an issue. The government is asking to export mere 2 percent of imported value of CKD starting FY22, which may increase to 10 percent by FY26. The export could be of parts or assembled cars. The number is not big; but resolve is missing. There are some Chinese new entrants which are experimenting with exporting fully assembled cars. Their localization is very low, but they still are tapping the market. On the other hand, biggest Japanese player by value in the CKD market was able to exports carpetsin recent months. If this export policy must continue, there is a good chance that Chinese players will grab some share. Chinese are better in EVs, and they don\u2019t have strong presence in right hand driving markets. They can start with Pakistan to cater to local and export market, as it might be better to tap markets such as Keyna from Pakistan (both are righthand markets) versus doing in China which is a left-hand market. The EV giant BYD has already announced its entry in Pakistan, and it is a matter of time, before it turns big. Thus, the Japanese must rethink the strategy by creating more value for consumer from localization and be innovative in exporting. If they cannot export in the existing setup, they can buy auto part players which are up for sale, and some have potential for exports. The status quo of infancy till attaining scale is near expiration.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/epaper.brecorder.com\/2024\/04\/09\/2-page\/990138-news.html","title":"Apr 09, 2024","sourceDomain":"epaper.brecorder.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7183389744867721216","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7183389744867721216","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7183389744200826880","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d8K4ubbC"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d8K4ubbC\nForever an Infant:Japs Demand an Export ban."},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7183389744200826880"}}},{"createdAt":1712397480000,"insightId":"82756aeb-71ed-4853-8c18-45777302c03a","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQEm6zSnCGKXHw\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712240273123?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=XvkE4UD3kR9Dw2Niugqx_yNoFHDrIIJejRbRZBn9ZG0","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D5627AQEm6zSnCGKXHw\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1712240273123?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=XvkE4UD3kR9Dw2Niugqx_yNoFHDrIIJejRbRZBn9ZG0"}]},"description":"According to a notification, Eid holidays will be observed from April 10 to April 13.","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1825563","title":"Govt announces four Eid holidays"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7182315720112824322","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7182315720112824322","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7182315719349420033","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dDdHJSXD"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dDdHJSXD\nGovernment announces four Eidholidays"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7182315719349420033"}}},{"createdAt":1711773480000,"insightId":"15fcb739-20bb-4167-9401-34acae02ccee","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQFTHu7lCl5F0w\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711773521934?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=rXC8OvCf1c-3DaPZWvCa2IoovNAUqzLQRUqZVIetlAc","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQFTHu7lCl5F0w\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711773521934?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=rXC8OvCf1c-3DaPZWvCa2IoovNAUqzLQRUqZVIetlAc"}]},"description":"LONDON: UK greenhouse gas emissions fell by 5.4 percent in 2023, largely due to a reduction in the amount of gas used in power stations, according to official data published on Thursday.

Net emissions of all greenhouse gases were estimated to have been 384.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023, compared to 406.2 million tonnes in 2022, the government\u2019s provisional figures showed. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 6.6 percent annually to 302.8 million tonnes, part of a 52.7-percent decrease in total greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. The UK government said the figures showed that the country was halfway to reaching net-zero emissions. \u201cThis latest drop in our emissions follows the UK\u2019s achievement in becoming the first major economy to halve its polluting carbon emissions,\u201d said Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho. The UK government\u2019s target is to reach net zero by 2050. Gas use for electricity generation fell 21.1 percent in 2023, \u201cprimarily due to higher electricity imports from France, as well as UK electricity demand continuing to decline\u201d, said the report. The reduced demand is mainly due to \u201cgreater efficiency resulting from improvements in technology and a decline in the relative importance of energy-intensive industries\u201d, it added. High energy prices are also likely to have been a factor, with less fuel being used to heat buildings and by industry, said the report. Nuclear and renewables accounted for 56.7 percent of fuel used for electricity generation in 2023, up from 22.2 percent in 1990. Domestic transport remained the largest source of UK emissions, accounting for 29.1 percent in 2023, almost all of which are from carbon dioxide, the main source being the use of petrol and diesel in road vehicles. However, the sector\u2019s emissions decreased by 1.4 percent in 2023, the first fall since 2020 when travel was heavily restricted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Germany in January reported a 9.8 percent fall in carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 due to the sharp decline in coal consumption and crisis in its industrial sector. And France last week said its domestic greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 4.8 percent over the same period.\u2014AFP","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/epaper.brecorder.com\/2024\/03\/30\/20-page\/989297-news.html","title":"Mar 30, 2024","sourceDomain":"epaper.brecorder.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7179698582663413760","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7179698582663413760","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7179698582155894784","message":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d84DF4Xd"}}}],"text":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/d84DF4Xd\nUK greenhouse gas emissions fell 5.4pc in 2023: data\n"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7179698582155894784"}}},{"createdAt":1710915000000,"insightId":"261df206-08c6-4384-842e-9e69ae68a155","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[{"type":"LIKE","count":1}],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:ugcPost:7176097775795724290","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7176097775795724290","reactionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7176097775795724290","message":{"attributes":[],"text":""},"rootActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"referenceContentSummary":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:multiPhoto:1000146060497"}},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7175823599902023680","message":{"attributes":[{"start":775,"length":18,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:hamdarduniversity"}}},{"start":794,"length":14,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:nayanazimabad"}}},{"start":809,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HashtagAttributedEntity":{"hashtag":"urn:li:hashtag:ramadanfootballgoldcup"}}}],"text":"Hamdard University in Collaboration with Naya Nazimabad unite for the grand opening of the Ramadan Football Gold Cup, celebrating teamwork and community spirit. \n\nJoined by esteemed Chief Guest Vice Chancellor Hamdard University Prof. Dr. Syed Shabib Ul Hasan, President Naya Nazimabad Gymkhana Syed Muhammed Talha, Registrar Hamdard University Kaleem Ahmed Ghias, Captain of the Pakistan football team Saddam Hussain, Major Imran, DSR Rangers Ishaq Malik, Saif Khan, Mohsin Yousufzai (Head of Sports, Hamdard University), Muhammad Asif (Head of Sports, Naya Nazimabad), Shamir Khattak (Head of Sports, Zee International), Hamza Yameen (Manager, SEA), Ismail Khattak (Sports Officer), and Chairman NSA Intikhab Alam Zubair. \n\nTogether, let's champion unity through sports! \n\n#HamdardUniversity #NayaNazimabad #RamadanFootballGoldCup"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7175823599902023680"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7176097775795724290"}}},{"createdAt":1710739740000,"insightId":"757bfa4b-752e-41da-bc2b-6538ee52cb27","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQF-8dklfstIjA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711969369897?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=GoMEh0KLHVRyf5tv0s2TQ_m4s61DDv9x2-xcFbbe0iM","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQF-8dklfstIjA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711969369897?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=GoMEh0KLHVRyf5tv0s2TQ_m4s61DDv9x2-xcFbbe0iM"}]},"description":"CAIRO: The EU chief and five European leaders visited cash-strapped Egypt on Sunday to announce a 7.4-billion-euro financial package focussed on boosting energy trade and stemming irregular migrant flows to the 27-member bloc.

The deal will include billions in credit over coming years for highly indebted Egypt, and stepping up energy sales that could help Europe \u201cmove further away from Russian gas\u201d, said a senior European Commission official. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 who was joined by the leaders of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece and Italy \u2014 met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ahead of the scheduled signing ceremony. The Strategic and Comprehensive Partnership agreement includes five billion euros in loans over four years, 1.8 billion euros in investment and hundreds of millions for bilateral projects including on migration, the official said on condition of anonymity. Egypt, mired in a painful economic crisis, borders war-battered Libya and the centres of two ongoing conflicts \u2014 the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Sudan\u2019s war between the regular armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. \u201cEgypt is a critical country for Europe today and for the days to come,\u201d said the commission official, who pointed to Egypt\u2019s \u201cimportant position in a very difficult neighbourhood, bordering Libya, Sudan and the Gaza Strip\u201d. Egypt already hosts around nine million migrants and refugees, including four million Sudanese and 1.5 million Syrians, according to the UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration. The EU official said the deal includes steps to cooperate on \u201csecurity, counter-terrorism cooperation and protection of borders, in particular the southern one\u201d with Sudan. The Gaza Strip, where Israel is at war with the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas since the October 7 attack, \u201cwill not be the main focus but will be part of the discussion\u201d in Cairo, the official added. The delegation included three Mediterranean leaders \u2014 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, her Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides. They were joined by Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. The agreement follows several controversial deals the EU has sealed in northern Africa \u2014 with Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania \u2014 to stem the flow of irregular migrants across the Mediterranean Sea. The EU\u2019s border agency Frontex last year recorded nearly 158,000 migrant arrivals in Europe via the dangerous sea route, up by 50 percent on the previous year. The trend has sparked rising anti-immigrant rhetoric in Europe and gains for right-wing populist parties in several EU nations. Human rights groups have strongly condemned the deals with authoritarian governments. US-based Human Rights Watch said it had documented \u201carbitrary arrests and mistreatment of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees by Egyptian authorities\u201d. HRW criticised what it labelled \u201cthe EU\u2019s cash-for-migration-control approach\u201d which it said \u201cstrengthens authoritarian rulers while betraying human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and activists whose work involves great personal risk\u201d. Egypt stresses that migrant boats have not sailed from its coast in recent years. But Egyptians still arrive in Europe by sea, mostly via Libya or Tunisia to Italy. Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation, is in dire need of financial help as it weathers a severe economic crisis marked by rapid inflation. The International Monetary Fund this month agreed an $8 billion loan package after Cairo implemented reforms including a flexible exchange rate and raised interest rates. Egypt\u2019s economy, dominated by military-linked enterprises and recently focused on infrastructure mega-projects, has been hit hard by a series of recent economic shocks. Among them have been the Covid pandemic\u2019s impact on the tourism sector, higher prices for food imports amid the Ukraine war and attacks by Yemen\u2019s Huthi rebels on Red Sea shipping that have slashed Suez Canal revenues. Egypt\u2019s external debt has ballooned to nearly $165 billion, and the cost of servicing it is expected to reach $42 billion this year.\u2014AFP","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/epaper.brecorder.com\/2024\/03\/18\/9-page\/988104-news.html","title":"Mar 18, 2024","sourceDomain":"epaper.brecorder.com"}},"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:activity:7175362612778385410","threadUrn":"urn:li:activity:7175362612778385410","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:share:7175362612304482305","message":{"attributes":[{"start":61,"length":24,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.HyperlinkAttributedEntity":{"url":"https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dvx6WPrB"}}}],"text":"EU, Egypt agree 7.4bn euro deal focused on energy, migration\nhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/dvx6WPrB"},"entityUrn":"urn:li:share:7175362612304482305"}}},{"createdAt":1710526920000,"insightId":"5e88fcaf-e11e-4bfe-bbcc-ff422deaba3e","activityUnion":{"postActivity":{"contentSummaryUnion":{"ingestedContentSummary":{"image":{"attributes":[{"originalImageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQHKdEVgpc8gbA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711911708164?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=FUPE36gwDJx-tZaYKfYJ-f_AUjA-Zg9ngbxJQaSk4Ck","sourceType":"URL","imageUrl":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/sync\/D4D27AQHKdEVgpc8gbA\/articleshare-shrink_800\/0\/1711911708164?e=1717977600&v=beta&t=FUPE36gwDJx-tZaYKfYJ-f_AUjA-Zg9ngbxJQaSk4Ck"}]},"description":"SINGAPORE\/TOKYO: Japanese rubber futures extended gains to an eighth session on Thursday, touching a seven-year high, as the contract tracked soaring physical rubber prices amid supply concerns, while higher oil prices also prompted buying.

Brent crude futures were down 58 cents or 0.7% to $82.38 a barrel by 1417 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures inched down 67 cents or 0.8% to $78.46 a barrel. Oil prices retreated from near a 2024 high hit on Wednesday after US data showed oil stocks rose less than expected and fuel inventories fell, in a sign of robust demand. Still, markets were bracing for the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve could delay its first interest rate cut to the second half of this year in a boost to the US dollar, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists. A strong greenback dents demand for dollar-denominated oil among buyers using other currencies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday continued progress on inflation \u201cis not assured\u201d, though the US central bank still expects to reduce its benchmark interest rate this year. Meanwhile, China\u2019s import and export growth beat estimates, suggesting global trade is turning a corner in a positive signal for policymakers as they try to shore up economic recovery. China posted a 5.1% rise in imports in the first two months of 2024 from a year earlier to about 10.74 million barrels per day (bpd), customs data showed on Thursday, as crude purchases ramped up to meet fuel sales during the Lunar New Year holiday.\u2014Reuters","resolvedUrl":"https:\/\/epaper.brecorder.com\/2024\/03\/08\/9-page\/987212-news.html","title":"Mar 08,
