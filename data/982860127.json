This is an investigation of drug optimization and patient outcomes when transitioning from traditional IV administrations to subcutaneous injections. The machine learning model is an extension based on a paper by Han Lou and Michael Hageman, Machine Learning Attempts for Predicting Human Subcutaneous Bioavailability of Monoclonal Antibodies, where they took 10 mAbs and analyzed 45 different features. To further extend this paper, we took an additional 10 monoclonal antibodies that were delivered subcutaneously, and took into account their dosage concentration as an extension to traditional PK properties. By including additional mAbs and dosage, a more sophisticated model can be produced with high scalability to deep learning modalities.","url":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2024.04.14.589447v2.abstract","name":"Potential Opportunities of Modeling Bioavailability for Monoclonal Antibodies: An Overview of mAbs and the current challenges of mAb development","publisher":"BioxRiv","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADqVQV8BKInsv94ptdWTa0pqhowvVwaX3tg,NAME_SEARCH,B9aA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADlY6jIBwXf18mGZGn3uS9UD8PBktNsfGAI,NAME_SEARCH,DQ0c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADrzlaEBpG-MwcTfsP2T3ooEFzVkbO_FuEM,NAME_SEARCH,GqN3)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAD4zbScBcB50hngJ6I58ILy8yqNv7vmkVBE,NAME_SEARCH,_FzG)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":8,"year":2024},"description":"This review rigorously investigates the evolving pharmacological landscape for metabolic disorders, focusing on Phenylketonuria (PKU), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Galactosemia, Medium Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD), and Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we meticulously searched databases such as NHS, Rare Diseases, Pubchem, Clinical Trials, DrugBank, PubMed, and Mayo Clinic, spanning from January 2000 to December 2023. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and potential of both FDA-approved drugs and those in clinical trials. The review revealed significant advancements in the treatment of disorders like PKU, with drugs like Kuvan facilitating improved metabolic functioning. In IBD, treatments have progressed to specifically target inflammatory pathways using drugs like Azathioprine and Mesalazine, shifting away from broader immunosuppressants. Galactosemia and MCADD, disorders without definitive cures, have shown potential in clinical trials with investigational drugs like AT-007 and Triheptanoin. Particularly intriguing are the ongoing trials for PWS, a complex syndrome, where Oral NNZ-2591 and Oxytocin demonstrate promising potential. These findings highlight the critical importance of specialized treatment strategies, tailored to address the unique metabolic challenges posed by each disorder. The diverse nature of these disorders necessitates a multifaceted approach, combining current scientific knowledge with innovative drug development. This study not only contributes to a better understanding of existing treatments but also emphasizes the need for continued research and development to uncover more effective and personalized therapeutic options for managing these varied metabolic disorders.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-4228679\/v1","name":"An Analysis of Metabolic Conditions and Current Therapeutic Approaches: A Systematic Review","publisher":"Research Square","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADqVQV8BKInsv94ptdWTa0pqhowvVwaX3tg,NAME_SEARCH,B9aA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAEKpDUoBCkMb2_t6hXnkpykHuLpD44a3eHM,NAME_SEARCH,mXT2)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAD4zbScBcB50hngJ6I58ILy8yqNv7vmkVBE,NAME_SEARCH,_FzG)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":4,"day":23,"year":2024},"description":"Polymer-based biomaterials have received a lot of attention due to their biomedical, agricultural, and industrial potential.

This comprehensive paper delves into the evolving field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and their pivotal role in cancer therapy. We have conducted an in-depth exploration of the structural components of ADCs, including target antigens, monoclonal antibodies, chemical linkers, and cytotoxic payloads, each playing a crucial role in determining the efficacy and safety profile of these novel therapies. We further dissect the engineering intricacies of ADCs, focusing on their ability to target specific cancer cell antigens while minimizing off-target effects, thus offering a more focused treatment with reduced systemic side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. This approach holds promise in a heightened therapeutic index and decreased toxicity. The mechanisms and effector functions of ADCs are explored, highlight- ing their multifaceted strategy in combating cancer. We include a comprehensive look at how ADCs operate from initial blood circulation to the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. We also review several key ADCs currently in use or under investigation, offering insights into their unique mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and clinical implications. The discussion extends to drug creation modalities, focusing on innovative conjugation techniques that enhance ADC homogeneity and therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, the paper underscores the transformative potential of ADCs in the realm of cancer treatment, marking a shift towards more precise and targeted therapeutic approaches. By offering a thorough analysis of ADC technology, this paper sheds light on the prospects of these groundbreaking therapies in the ongoing fight against cancer.","url":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202404.0658\/v1","name":"Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment - The Emergence and Impact of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): A Systematic Review","publisher":"Preprints.org","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADqVQV8BKInsv94ptdWTa0pqhowvVwaX3tg,NAME_SEARCH,B9aA)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC3X4r0BitgwZe7yRzkTUiV7nB6maVVKRAg,NAME_SEARCH,Fl3e)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAADlY6jIBwXf18mGZGn3uS9UD8PBktNsfGAI,NAME_SEARCH,DQ0c)"},{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAD4zbScBcB50hngJ6I58ILy8yqNv7vmkVBE,NAME_SEARCH,_FzG)"}]}],"positions":null,"posts":[{"createdAt":1716254040000,"insightId":"9a40bd28-a195-467f-8d9d-fee0c0cdac42","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7197786348324274176,7198491272251080704)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7197786348324274176","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":10,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:140453144"}}}],"text":"Ying Zhang Yes, it was great Xin Wang and Ned was there so at least the first part of risk assessment framework was represented."},"activityUrl":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/sales-navigator\/urn:li:ugcPost:7197786348324274176"}}},{"createdAt":1716246420000,"insightId":"9ff5b5a2-fa4d-4f1f-80f9-177ca5e5af45","activityUnion":{"commentActivity":{"socialMetadata":{"reactionTypeCounts":[],"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesSocialMetadata:urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7197786348324274176,7198459441262772226)","threadUrn":"urn:li:ugcPost:7197786348324274176","reactionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"canComment":true},"commentary":{"attributes":[{"start":0,"length":23,"value":{"com.linkedin.common.MemberAttributedEntity":{"member":"urn:li:member:7837066"}}}],"text":"Christina Zuch de Zafra It would have been even better if you were there.
