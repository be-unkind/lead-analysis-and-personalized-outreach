Others have written on this better (Jacob Plieth and Ron Leuty), but here\u2019s the short story:\n\nThe molecule was discovered in a collaboration between Sunesis & Biogen that started 20 years ago. Biogen deprioritized oncology under CEO Scangos and stopped working on RAF in 2010, reverting rights back to Sunesis.\n\nBut tovo was covered by key patents from the collaboration, which were assigned to Sunesis.  Fwiw, two of the co-inventors of tovo later became Atlas entrepreneurs: Gnanasambandam Kumar Kumaravel (Padlock) and Alexey \"Alex\" Lugovskoy (Diagonal). Small world of both the Biogen diaspora and the Atlas Venture network.\n\nTakeda licensed it from Sunesis in 2011, and over next 6-7 years its clinical work in melanoma failed to deliver.\n\nPhysician-scientist\/pediatric oncologist Samuel Blackman co-founded Day One with Julie Grant in 2019 to focus on pediatric cancer. They license tovo from Takeda in 2020, and my partner Michael Gladstone convinced Atlas to join Canaan Partners in the $60M Series A, as did Access Industries. Company goes public in a 2021 IPO.\n\nSunesis retained some economics in tovo. It did a reverse merger in 2021, and became Viracta. It sold its tovo milestones\/royalties to Xoma later that year.\n\nAfter the success of Firefly-1 in pediatric LGG, tovo (Ojemda) was granted accelerated approval, with the ongoing Phase 3 Firefly-2 study underway.\n\nAmazing journey, with many teams participating along the way.
