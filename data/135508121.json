Raw data were reconstructed using projection-based material decomposition processing algorithm. Image quality was evaluated in terms of spatial resolution, SNR and CNR.\nResults: SNR, CNR, HU, DLP and spatial resolution were evaluated for this technique. In all cases of pulmonary embolism (18\/18, 100 % PPV) the site of embolus and the effects in the pulmonary parenchyma were accurately depicted. In angiographic evaluation of endovascular stents, metallic artifacts were successfully suppressed and endoleakage was accurately visualized in all cases (misinterpreted sites with metallic artifacts in conventional CTA acquisition). The mean Dose Length Product was 1454 mGy\/cm compared with 1735 mGy\/cm for standard triple-phase CT angiography. Results were compared using paired t-tests and x2 tests.\nConclusion: CTA based in spectral imaging techniques offers significantly higher diagnostic confidence in a single acquisition. Evaluation suggests that obtaining spectral imaging CTA is suitable for pulmonary embolism detection and surveillance after endovascular repair of aneurysms.","publisher":"European Congress of Radiology (ECR 2011), March 3-7, 2011 Vienna, Austria","url":"http:\/\/ipp.myesr.org\/esr\/ecr2011\/index.php?v=posterd&poid=4372&ippwwwsid=kaqj2hha80ll6b1bq3s4r65us2","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAgTsJkBadekgCVWopALI7krpafzPEL0eXw,NAME_SEARCH,bwhX)"}]},{"name":"2nd IC-SCCE Athens, Greece, on 5-8 July, 2006","description":"1.
