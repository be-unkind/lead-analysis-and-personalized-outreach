finite-element (FE)-based strength. Transaxial QCT scans were obtained from 36 major, cadaveric, long bones (humerus, radius, femur and tibia) from 4 females and 2 males, 53 to 86 years old. These images were used to construct the FE models and to develop the QCT-based bone strength indicators under every-day, simplified loading conditions. We have evaluated the performance of area-weighted (AW), density-weighted (DW) and modulus-weighted (MW) rigidity measures as well as popular strength indicators like section modulus (Z) and stress-strain index (SSI). We have also developed a novel strength metric, the centroid deviation, which analyzes the spatial distribution of the centroids along the length of the bone. The correlation results show that the MW polar moment of inertia and the MW moment of inertia are the two top-performers for all bones and loading conditions (average r>0.89). The MW centroid deviations correlated highly with the estimated load to fracture for all bones under compression (r>0.83), except for the humerus (r=0.67). Consistently DW or MW rigidity measures produced a statistically significant improvement in capturing bone strength compared to AW rigidity measures. As expected, MW rigidity measures showed a higher correlation with the FE-based fracture load than the DW rigidity measures; however, the improvement was not statistically significant. Through this study we present a short-list of useful QCT-based strength parameters that correlate well with FE-based fracture load. Although a few parameters perform reasonably well across most bones and loading conditions, a judicious assessment of bone strength should include multiple parameters evaluated at multiple critical locations in the long bones, with attention to the type of loading and bone type.","url":"http:\/\/www.thebonejournal.com\/article\/S8756-3282(11)01294-4\/abstract","name":"Development of Quantitative Computed-Tomography-Based Strength Indicators for the Identification of Low Bone-Strength Individuals in a Clinical Environment.","publisher":"Bone","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIVtbMBiyNLrVGnkwXAtAy4HaRbkk1AST0,NAME_SEARCH,oWuG)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":9,"day":25,"year":2008},"description":"Objective: Bone strength is a function of both material and architectural properties. However, bone geometry or architecture, which determines the distribution of bone, is an underappreciated determinant of bone strength. The aim of the study\nwas to evaluate the contribution of only architecture to bone strength. Methods:We used 2-D (planar) geometric information\nfrom radiographs of human radii to construct 3-D finite-element models. To transition from 2-D to 3-D (volume) space, we\nassumed that all bone cross-sections were elliptical in shape. The finite-element models were subjected to cantilever loading\nto determine the locations in the bone with the highest propensity to fracture (points of maximum stress). The finite-elementanalysis results of the models generated from radiographs of both normal (18) and temporary-brittle-bone-disease (11) infants\nwere subjected to a receiver operating curve analysis. The area under the receiver operating curve was used to evaluate the\npower of a given bone-strength indicator in segregating the two populations. The actual choice of the material properties\n(Young\u2019s modulus or Poisson\u2019s ratio) was not critical for this study, since the finite element analyses were designed to capture\nthe difference in the bone strength of the two populations only based on their architecture. Therefore, the material properties\nwere assumed to be the same in both the normal and TBBD populations. Results: The area under the curve of the bending\nload required to cause fracture among the two populations was 0.82. Other bone-strength indicators, such as average section\nmodulus, cortical thickness and bone length, were associated with an area under the curve of 0.75, 0.73 and 0.63, respectively.\nConclusion: The results of the finite-element-analysis suggest that the temporary-brittle-bone-disease population has an\naltered bone geometry, which increases susceptibility to fracture under normal bending loads.","url":"http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/34\/36VARGHESE.pdf","name":"Analysis of Bone Strength from Pediatric Radiographs of the Forearm.","publisher":"Journal of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interaction","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIVtbMBiyNLrVGnkwXAtAy4HaRbkk1AST0,NAME_SEARCH,oWuG)"}]},{"name":"Volumetric Micro-Computed Tomographic Imaging of Lung Anatomy","publishedOn":{"year":2015},"publisher":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","url":"http:\/\/jnm.snmjournals.org\/content\/56\/supplement_3\/2516.short","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIVtbMBiyNLrVGnkwXAtAy4HaRbkk1AST0,NAME_SEARCH,oWuG)"}]},{"name":"Truncating mutation in the autophagy gene UVRAG  confers oncogenic properties and chemosensitivity  in colorectal cancers","publishedOn":{"month":6,"year":2015},"publisher":"Nature Communications","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIVtbMBiyNLrVGnkwXAtAy4HaRbkk1AST0,NAME_SEARCH,oWuG)"}]},{"name":"A new (semi-) automated method to quantify primate phalangeal curvature from 3D virtual models: new estimates for fossil hominin phalanges","publishedOn":{"month":4,"year":2015},"publisher":"PaleoAnthropology","url":"http:\/\/www.paleoanthro.org\/media\/journal\/content\/PAS2015A.pdf","authors":[{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAIVtbMBiyNLrVGnkwXAtAy4HaRbkk1AST0,NAME_SEARCH,oWuG)"}]},{"publishedOn":{"month":1,"day":27,"year":2017},"description":"Purpose: Evaluate the feasibility of spectral analysis, particularly fast fourier transform (FFT), to help clinicians differentiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor grades using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images of renal masses, quantitatively, and compare their performance to the Fuhrman grading system. Materials and Methods: Regions of interest of the whole lesion were manually segmented and co-registered from multiphase CT acquisitions of 95 patients with ccRCC. Here, FFT is employed to objectively quantify the texture of a tumor surface by evaluating tissue gray-level patterns and automatically measure frequency-based texture metrics. An independent t-test or a Wilcoxon rank sum test (depending on the data distribution) was used to determine if the spectral analysis metrics would produce statistically significant differences between the tumor grades. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the usefulness of spectral metrics in predicting the ccRCC grade. Results: The Wilcoxon test showed that there was a significant difference in complexity index between the different tumor grades, p < 0.01 at all the four phases of CECT acquisition. In all cases a positive correlation was observed between tumor grade and complexity index. ROC analysis revealed the importance of the entropy of FFT amplitude, FFT phase and complexity index and its ability to identify grade 1 and grade 4 tumors from the rest of the population. Conclusion: Our study suggests that FFT-based spectral metrics can differentiate between ccRCC grades, and in combination with other metrics improve patient management and prognosis of renal masses.","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1117\/12.2256871.","name":"; Fast Fourier transform-based analysis of renal masses on contrast-enhanced computed tomography images for grading of tumor.
